The **UN’s** agency for Palestinian refugees said it would run out of fuel in **Gaza**—which it needs to power hospital equipment and provide drinking water—in less than a day. The agency says it is sheltering nearly 600,000 Palestinians in UN facilities across [the enclave](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/23/life-in-gaza-is-a-series-of-calculations-how-much-water-do-you-really-need). Meanwhile, António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said that he is “shocked by misrepresentations” of comments he made on Tuesday. Mr Guterres had said that Hamas’s attack (which he condemned) “did not happen in a vacuum”. Israel reacted furiously; it said it would block UN employees from receiving visas and the Israeli envoy to the UN called on him to resign.

In a primetime speech Binyamin Netanyahu, **Israel’s** prime minister, said that the country is preparing for a ground invasion of **Gaza**, adding that “all Hamas militants are doomed”. According to the *Wall Street Journal*, Israel has delayed its invasion in order for America to move missile defences into [the region](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/25/the-three-steps-on-americas-ladder-of-military-escalation) to protect its troops. On Sunday Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, warned of the “prospect of a significant escalation” against American forces.

America’s **House of Representative**s managed to elect a permanent speaker, Republican **Mike Johnson** of Louisiana, after three chaotic weeks without one. All 220 Republicans present voted for the staunchly conservative Mr Johnson—a show of unity after a [drawn-out civil war](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/19/how-the-republican-civil-war-in-the-house-could-end) saw the party nominate four candidates. One failed (thrice) on the House floor; two dropped their bids before that stage.

Xi Jinping, **China’s** president, held an unexpected meeting with Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, in Beijing. The **American** politician said they discussed ways to “accelerate our progress on climate”. Earlier the Chinese leader called for [stable relations](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/10/12/chinas-ties-with-america-are-warming-a-bit) with America ahead of a visit to Washington by Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister, and Mr Xi’s expected meeting with President Joe Biden in November.

**Deutsche Bank**, **Lloyds Banking Group** and **Santander**, a set of banks, reported stronger-than-expected results for the third quarter, buoyed by high net-interest margins. Santander said its net-profit in the third quarter was up 20% compared to the same period last year. Deutsche Bank said that it is on track for its highest annual revenue in seven years.

**Otis** weakened to a tropical storm after making landfall as a category-five hurricane in the state of Guerrero in southern Mexico. Residents in parts of the state affected by the storm temporarily lost communication after it knocked out phone lines, and it is expected to lash out up to 50cm (nearly 20 inches) of rain.

**China** and **Colombia** upgraded their diplomatic relations to a “strategic partnership” after a meeting between Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s president, and Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart. The leaders also inked 12 cooperation deals, including on beef trade. Colombia, a key ally of America, is now one of 10 South American countries to have elevated relations with China, which seeks to [gain economic and geopolitical influence](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/06/15/what-does-china-want-from-latin-america-and-the-caribbean) in the region.

### America’s economy keeps going and going

It is the [energizer-bunny economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/23/americas-astonishing-economic-growth-goes-up-another-gear). The Federal Reserve started raising interest rates 18 months ago, a policy that would normally reduce growth. But on Thursday America is expected to report that GDP in the third quarter grew at an annual rate of 4.3%, a scorching pace by modern standards. Just a few months ago most analysts had predicted that America would be flirting with a downturn by now.

The economy is growing fast for two main reasons. Consumer spending has been buoyed both by savings accumulated during the pandemic and, more recently, by substantial wage increases. Businesses have also ramped up investments, motivated in part by subsidies for semiconductor and electric-vehicle factories. The question, as ever, is how long this can last. Rising [bond yields](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/forget-the-shutdown-americas-real-fiscal-worry-is-rising-bond-yields) over the past few months have made borrowing more expensive. That will eventually slow the economy, albeit later rather than sooner.

### A fractious European Union

Leaders of the European Union’s 27 member states will gather in Brussels for a two-day European Council meeting on Thursday. They are [divided](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/the-eus-response-to-the-crisis-in-israel-exposes-its-limits) over the bloc’s approach to the Middle East. Some countries, such as Germany, want to give unconditional support to Israel. Others, including Spain and Ireland, emphasise the plight of ordinary Palestinians. But most advocate a “humanitarian pause” in the fighting, as does the United Nations secretary-general, António Guterres.

Other points on the agenda are also likely to prove contentious. Countries disagree over a range of issues, including how to find more money to support Ukraine and ways to stem migration into the bloc. Several governments worry that the Israel-Gaza war will divert attention and resources from the war in Europe. Among the leaders at the summit will be Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, who recently met Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. That sort of diplomatic overture will peeve many other European leaders. In Brussels, they may take the opportunity to let him know.

### In Ukraine, the battle for Avdiivka

In what looks like a repeat of its costly and protracted campaign to capture Bakhmut, a small town in eastern Ukraine, Russia is redoubling its efforts to take [Avdiivka](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/14/now-russia-is-fighting-to-gain-territory-in-the-east-of-ukraine), another frontline town close to the Russian-held capital of the Donetsk province.

Avdiivka, which has been abandoned by its 30,000 residents and is now in ruins, is of little strategic value. But it has acquired symbolic importance. Russian forces have made small advances, claiming to have planted a flag on a lower slope of the 200-metre-high ash dump that towers above the battlefield. But they are losing horrifying numbers of men and many armoured vehicles.

Meanwhile, Ukraine is making only slow progress in the main theatre of its counter-offensive against Russia, near Robotyne in the south. But there are hopeful signs elsewhere. On Tuesday Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, hailed the effectiveness of the effort to limit Russian control of the Black Sea. That has opened temporary sea lanes for vital grain exports.

### The ECB’s rate break

The last time the European Central Bank’s head honchos came together to decide on interest rates, they agreed that the tightening regime had run its course. Economic data since then have only reinforced the view that inflation is coming down, and the economy weakening. When the ECB meets on Thursday, it will probably leave rates on hold.

Inflation came in at 4.3% in the year to September, down from 5.2% in August. Annual core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, also dropped by a percentage point. The purchasing managers’ index for the [euro-zone economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/31/europes-economy-looks-to-be-heading-for-trouble), a widely watched measure of business activity, dropped to a 35-month low in October.

But Israel’s war with Hamas is adding uncertainty to the economic outlook. At the same time, long-term interest rates, over which central banks have limited control, have increased considerably since September, dampening demand. To prevent a further weakening of the economy, the ECB should consider when to start cutting rates.

### Stories behind the music

The average American teenager spends more than two hours per day–[an eighth of their conscious life](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2008/12/18/why-music)–listening to music. Little wonder then that documentary filmmakers have long been fascinated by how songs are written and produced and by the [drama](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2018/08/17/music-feuds-can-be-a-lucrative-marketing-tool) that often surrounds musicians.

On Thursday “Doc’n Roll”, a music-documentary festival, opens in cinemas across Britain. This year, the festival’s tenth, the programme includes screenings of “Mutiny in Heaven”, the story of The Birthday Party, [Nick Cave](https://www.economist.com/1843/2016/09/13/nick-caves-haunting-masterpiece)’s first band, and “TLC Forever”, about one of the best-selling American girl groups of all time.

“Rock Chicks” tells the tale of women like Memphis Minnie, Sister Rosetta and Big Mama Thornton, who helped found rock’n’roll—and of the challenges faced by their successors. “I’m not here to be pretty,” quips Honeychild Coleman, a Brooklyn-based blues-punk musician who began her career in the early 1990s busking in the New York City subway. “I’m here to play guitar and make noise.”
