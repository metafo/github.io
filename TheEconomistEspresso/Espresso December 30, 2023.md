Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Dozens of people were killed and many more hurt in one of the heaviest waves of Russian [attacks](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis) in **Ukraine** for months. Ukrainian officials said 158 drones and missiles were launched across the country in the overnight attacks. Most were shot down, but civilian targets, including educational facilities, residential buildings and a maternity centre, were hit. President Joe Biden said that attacks showed that Congress “must step up” and approve [further military aid](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/20/a-majority-of-congressmen-want-more-military-aid-for-ukraine) for Ukraine “without delay”.

Dong Jun, a former head of the Chinese navy, was appointed **defence minister** following the mysterious disappearance of Li Shangfu, the previous incumbent. The position is largely ceremonial, but can involve working with America to reduce the risk of [conflict](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/11/how-to-prevent-a-war-between-america-and-china-over-taiwan). Mr Dong’s previous roles included senior command positions focused on the flashpoints of Taiwan and the [South China Sea](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/11/09/a-chinese-dispute-with-the-philippines-is-a-test-of-america).

South Africa asked the International Court of Justice to declare that **Israel** is “in breach of its obligations” under the Genocide Convention for its attacks on **Gaza**. Israel dismissed the claim as “baseless”. Earlier the UN warned that more than 150,000 people were being forced to flee [central Gaza](https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/10/17/israel-gaza-map-hamas-war) as Israeli forces expanded their ground offensive.

America’s **S&P 500 index** recorded a 24% rise for 2023 after a months-long rally fuelled by expectations that borrowing costs will fall in 2024. The gains were driven largely by big technology stocks, and helped boost global performance: the **MSCI World Index** was up by 22% for the year. London’s FTSE 100 struggled in comparison, up by less than 4%.

A Siberian [court](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/04/20/vladimir-putins-courts-are-stepping-up-repression) handed a nine-year prison sentence to **Ksenia Fadeyeva**—an ally of Alexei Navalny, **Russia**’s most important opposition leader—on trumped-up charges of extremism. Ms Fadeyeva was a regional co-ordinator for Mr Navalny’s organisation in Tomsk, a city in Siberia, where she also served as a councillor. On Thursday two Russian anti-war poets were given prison sentences of seven and five-and-a-half years respectively.

**JD.com**, a Chinese e-commerce company, won a years-long anti-monopoly lawsuit against its rival **Alibaba**. The firms have [accused each other](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/01/02/chinese-trustbusters-pursuit-of-alibaba-is-only-the-start) of pressuring merchants to sell exclusively through their respective platforms. A Beijing court ordered Alibaba to pay 1bn yuan ($141.3m) in damages for abusing its market dominance. In 2021 Alibaba was [fined 18.2bn yuan ($2.8bn)](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/04/08/chinas-rulers-want-more-control-of-big-tech) by Chinese regulators.

**Berlin**, Germany’s capital, declared a state of emergency ahead of **New Year’s Eve** and asked revellers not to attack police and fire-brigade officers with fireworks. The city’s “Silvester” celebrations are notoriously lively affairs; last year was especially violent. Chinese authorities, meanwhile, admitted that proposed bans in many cities on the use of fireworks during Lunar New Year (which takes place in February) would be difficult to enforce.

### 2024 in preview: Which books will be bestsellers?

*This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. This weekend, the year ahead in culture*

Several books expected to [sell well](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/what-will-be-the-bestsellers-in-the-coming-year) in 2024 will ask how artificial intelligence might reshape the world. Among the best are “AI Needs You”, a “humanist manifesto”, by Verity Harding, formerly of Google DeepMind, and “The Heart and the Chip: Our Bright Future with Robots”, by Daniela Rus of MIT.

Geopolitics will also be prominent on [bestseller lists](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/08/25/how-to-write-a-bestseller). Dale Copeland will chronicle how commerce has shaped America’s foreign policy. In “Putin and the Return of History” Martin Sixsmith puts the aggression of the Russian president in historical context.

[Percival Everett](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/06/these-are-the-economists-best-books-of-2022), [Yann Martel](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2002/10/24/fabulous), David Nicholls, Kiley Reid, Colm Tóibín and [Amor Towles](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/28/new-years-eve-as-described-in-fiction-is-a-grim-affair) will all return with new works of fiction. James Patterson has completed an unfinished manuscript by Michael Crichton, the late author of “Jurassic Park”. A previously unpublished novella by [Gabriel García Márquez](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2014/04/26/the-magician-in-his-labyrinth), who died in 2014, will also be released, and an adaptation of his most famous [work](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/11/03/six-books-you-didnt-know-were-propaganda), “One Hundred Years of Solitude”, is in production at Netflix.

### 2024 in preview: AI will transform Hollywood

*This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, the year ahead in culture*

The use of generative [artificial intelligence](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/ai-will-transform-every-aspect-of-hollywood-storytelling) in art will make storytelling more personalised and interactive. Films and gaming will change. The sheer amount of entertainment available will also balloon. Some predict that as soon as 2025 as much as 90% of online content will be AI-generated.

It will be a few years before a full-length blockbuster is written and produced entirely by AI. But the technology will be used to save time, automating and simplifying tasks like dubbing, film-editing and special effects. In “Here”, a film due out in 2024 that will reunite the team behind “Forrest Gump”, [stars](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/09/now-ai-can-write-sing-and-act-is-it-still-possible-to-be-a-star) including Tom Hanks will be “de-aged” using AI.

AI’s integration will not be painless. There will be clashes and lawsuits between artists and those who run AI platforms. And as creators grapple with its rise, they will channel their anxieties about technology into their work. Look out for more “Terminator”-style clashes between man and machine.

### 2024 in preview: Museums will multiply

*This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, the year ahead in culture*

After the covid-19 pandemic plunged museums into crisis, rising living costs continued to keep cash-strapped visitors away. But new optimism can be seen in the opening of some exciting [museums](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/museums-will-multiply-in-2024) in 2024.

A small but mighty one will open in Washington, DC, dedicated to Go-Go music, a style developed by black musicians in America’s capital. In Kyoto, Japan, a former Nintendo factory will reopen as a museum of video-game history. And London will see the opening of an immersive museum dedicated to Shakespeare. Visitors will be able to explore the bard’s life through whizzy installations and AI trickery.

Galleries are expanding in Latin America, too. The Latin American Art Museum in Buenos Aires is opening a second site. The Museu de Arte de São Paulo’s 180m-real ($36m) expansion will increase its size by two-thirds. Adriano Pedrosa, a Brazilian curator, will be the first Latin American to organise the Venice Biennale, the world’s most important contemporary-art gathering.

### 2024 in preview: A new era for African architecture

*This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, the year ahead in culture*

The legacy of colonisation still resonates in west Africa’s buildings. Benin’s politicians pass laws in a French-built villa, for example. But in 2024 several new constructions will herald a [new era](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/a-new-era-for-west-african-architecture) of architecture. A National Assembly building will open in Porto Novo, Benin’s capital, and an elegant cultural centre will be completed in Dakar in Senegal. Both were designed by Francis Kéré, the first black architect to win the Pritzker prize, an international architecture award.

Western-trained African architects are winning more prominent commissions and awards. Ideas, especially about how architecture can respond to climate change, are travelling in both directions. Mr Kéré’s projects bridge pre-colonial traditions and post-colonial modernity. For Benin’s new seat of democracy he drew inspiration from the palaver tree, a typical meeting-spot.

Africa has few architecture schools. Funding is a perpetual barrier. But architects who overcome these hurdles are making a mark on west Africa’s fast-growing cities.
