Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

The **European Union** unveiled its 13th package of [sanctions](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/03/05/western-sanctions-on-russia-are-like-none-the-world-has-seen) on **Russia**. The measures target entities believed to be supporting Russia’s “war machine”, according to Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. The EU also took aim at businesses in India and China with links to Russia’s war. The sanctions package was agreed after Hungary dropped its opposition. Meanwhile **Britain** placed sanctions on six Russians officials at the penal colony where [Alexei Navalny](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/16/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity) died.

**Somalia** agreed to allow **Turkey** to defend its territorial waters. Turkey’s navy already operates in Somali territory as part of an anti-piracy campaign. But Somalia’s prime minister, Hamza Abdi Barre, promised that the new deal would end “threats from abroad”. Tensions with neighbouring Ethiopia have risen since it signed [a deal](https://www.economist.com/films/2024/01/05/why-ethiopias-port-deal-with-somaliland-fuels-tensions) with Somalia’s breakaway region of Somaliland.

**Boeing** sacked the boss of the factory that builds 737 Max 9 jets, the type of plane that [shed a door](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/09/faulty-door-plugs-open-old-wounds-at-boeing) while in flight last month. The embattled firm said that Ed Clark, who oversees the broader 737 Max programme, would be replaced immediately as part of a leadership shake-up. After the January incident, the fleet was temporarily grounded by regulators.

**South Africa’s** finance minister, Enoch Godongwana, set out his budget in the run-up to May’s [general election](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/south-africa-faces-a-defining-election). He intends to raise an extra 15bn rand ($793m), much of it through “fiscal drag” (holding tax brackets in place as inflation lifts wages and prices). The government will also increase levies on alcohol, tobacco and other goods. South Africa’s economy is beset by unemployment, inflation, and high levels of public debt.

**Rio Tinto**, a British-Australian company, approved the development of a $20bn mining project in Guinea, west Africa. The vast scheme, which encompasses two mines, a port and a railway, is expected to start delivering iron ore next year. It offers a glint of hope for the global mining industry, which has spent [much of the past decade](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/18/why-the-worlds-mining-companies-are-so-stingy) in investors’ bad books.

A **Ukrainian air strike** killed over 65 Russian soldiers in occupied territory in the east of Ukraine, according to Russian military bloggers. The military base is believed to have been struck by [American-supplied HIMARS rockets](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/01/america-sends-advanced-missiles-to-help-ukraine-fend-off-russia). Video footage appears to show dozens of dead and wounded. The strike followed the Russian capture of [Avdiivka](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/20/towns-in-eastern-ukraine-fear-they-will-be-russias-next-target), a heavily contested nearby town, on Saturday.

The **European Space Agency** predicted that **ERS-2**, a satellite launched in 1995, will re-enter the atmosphere and fall to Earth on Wednesday. It will mostly burn up as it descends. Along with ERS-1, its older sibling, ERS-2 was one of the most sophisticated [satellites](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/02/07/nasas-pace-satellite-will-tackle-the-largest-uncertainty-in-climate-science) launched in the 1990s. They gathered data on floods, temperatures, ice fields and the ozone layer.

### Japan’s rocky relations with South Korea

On Thursday Japan marks Takeshima Day, an annual assertion of its claim over the Takeshima islets, which lie between it and South Korea. These contentious specks—which South Korea controls, and calls Dokdo—remain a prickly issue for the two countries, despite their broader warming of relations.

Under Kishida Fumio, Japan’s prime minister, and Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea’s president, the countries have sought to mend fences over their bitter past and focus on shared security challenges, such as an assertive China and a nuclear-armed North Korea. America has welcomed the [pair’s ](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/10/why-joe-biden-will-host-japan-and-south-koreas-leaders-at-camp-david)improved relationship, seeing such co-operation as pivotal for regional stability.

Takeshima Day itself is a minor event, launched in 2005 by Shimane, a Japanese prefecture close to the disputed islets. The national government usually sends a mid-ranking official to attend. But the celebration serves as a reminder of the many unresolved historical grievances that could derail the present-day goodwill.

### The ECB grapples with volatile inflation data

In both America and Europe inflation data are erratic. Inflation in January in America fell by less than expected. In the euro zone, after a low of 2.4% in November, headline inflation was higher in December and January, at 2.9% and 2.8%. Thursday’s release of detailed euro-zone inflation data for January, including seasonally adjusted figures, will give a better sense of how hard it will be for the European Central Bank to reach its inflation target of 2%. Minutes of the ECB’s meeting on January 25th, also released on Thursday, will indicate how the bank’s bigwigs see their next steps.

Europe’s economy, unlike America’s, is weak enough that inflation would be expected to fall eventually, even if that takes time. According to minutes of previous meetings, governing-council members emphasised factors that ought to reduce inflation: the cash buffers of firms and households may be exhausted and higher interest rates will [weaken economies](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/18/the-countries-which-raised-rates-first-are-now-cutting-them). One more inflation reading may just be what it takes to convince them to cut rates.

### Colombia’s struggle to choose an attorney-general

Colombia’s Supreme Court will meet for the third time on Thursday in an effort to elect the country’s next attorney-general. It has had the president’s list of candidates—all women—for months and should have made its choice by December 7th. Ten days ago the cost of the delay materialised when the mandate of the outgoing attorney-general, Francisco Barbosa expired.

The deadlock prompted protests in major cities earlier this month. The president, [Gustavo Petro](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/01/25/colombias-first-avowedly-left-wing-president-is-mired-in-scandal), fulminates that an elite “mafia” does not want to lose control of the prosecutor’s office to his nominee. On the other hand, all are aware that the new attorney-general may oversee investigations into Mr Petro’s son, brother and former chief of staff. The day after the deadline expired the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights noted the risks to Colombia’s justice system and urged the court to comply with its constitutional obligation, noting too that all three candidates were suitable for the role. The justices would be wise to take heed.

### A private space odyssey

Thursday may see the first ever Moon landing pulled off by a private company. On February 15th a SpaceX Falcon 9 [rocket](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/01/09/an-american-rocket-has-a-fine-debut-not-so-the-moon-lander-on-board) carried *Odysseus* into orbit. The landing craft, made by Intuitive Machines, an American company, aims to touch down near the Moon’s south pole—an area of great interest to scientists and never visited by spacecraft before, in part because of its challenging terrain.

Intuitive Machines is not the first private company to attempt a Moon landing. Others have tried, and failed. In April 2023 *HAKUTO-R*, sent by Japanese firm ispace, crashed. In January *Peregrine*, made by Astrobiotic, another American company, failed to reach the Moon because of a propellant leak.

*Odysseus* carries NASA scientific instruments and is partially funded by the agency as part of its “commercial lunar payload services” programme (as was *Peregrine*). This scheme is designed to encourage [companies](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/01/18/which-firm-will-win-the-new-moon-race) to develop Moon-landers. The hope is that they can then support NASA’s efforts, which include taking [humans back to the Moon](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/astronauts-are-returning-to-the-moonwell-sort-of) before 2030.

### George Orwell’s missing years

As befits the most significant political writer of the 20th century, [George Orwell’s](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/08/04/interest-in-george-orwell-and-his-dystopian-fiction-is-high) life has been picked over in detail. Yet a crucial period, when he served as a young policeman in the British colony of Burma (now Myanmar), remains perplexingly obscure. Shortly after leaving Eton he arrived in Rangoon in 1922, an unremarkable scion of the imperial establishment, but returned to Britain five years later a socialist and anti-imperialist.

His 1934 novel “Burmese Days” gives few clues as to his emotional transformation during those years. So now Paul Theroux has imagined these changes in “Burma Sahib”, a novel published on Thursday. The American travel writer brilliantly relates the gradual alienation of the shy, gangly, bookish Eric Blair (as he was known before adopting his pen-name) from the officials who propped up the edifice of imperial rule. And Blair was markedly different from the *pukka* bores and sadists around him: he learned the [Burmese](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/14/jack-jennings-was-one-of-the-allied-pows-who-built-the-burma-railway) language, which was enough for his superiors to regard him as an outsider.
