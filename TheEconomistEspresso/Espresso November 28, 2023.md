Eleven hostages were freed by **Hamas**—the fourth such release since **Israel** and the militant group began a temporary truce on Friday. Earlier **Qatar’s** foreign ministry said that the [truce](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/26/a-brutal-battle-for-southern-gaza-beckons-after-the-truce-ends), originally scheduled to end on Tuesday, has been extended by two days. Qatari officials did not give further details about the extension, but the original truce agreement stipulated that Hamas could buy an additional day for every ten additional hostages it released. The pause in fighting has also allowed supplies of food, fuel and medicine to enter Gaza.

**Germany’s** government presented a budget which would suspend the “debt brake”, a limit on borrowing enshrined in the constitution, in order to borrow €45bn ( $49bn) to fund green projects and industrial subsidies. On November 15th Germany’s constitutional court [ruled](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/15/german-judges-toss-a-spanner-into-the-governments-spending-plans) that a plan to reallocate €60bn earmarked for pandemic spending was unconstitutional. The budget must still be approved by parliament.

**Geert Wilders’s** attempts to form a [Dutch government](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/25/geert-wilderss-dutch-election-win-is-a-headache-for-europe) hit another snag when Gom van Strien, a senator he appointed to find coalition partners, resigned owing to a fraud scandal. Most major political parties long ruled out working with [Mr Wilders’s](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/24/who-is-geert-wilders-the-surprise-winner-of-the-dutch-election) hard-right Party for Freedom. But his surprise [election win](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/23/geert-wilderss-election-win-leaves-the-dutch-in-an-awful-quandary) means it will be nearly impossible to form a government without him.

**Niger’s** ruling [junta](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/01/why-the-nightmare-in-niger-is-the-worlds-problem) repealed a law that criminalised the transport of migrants through the northern part of the country. The law, enacted in 2015, slowed West African migration to **Europe**; the same year, the EU set up a multi-billion trust fund for African countries to stop people from leaving. Nigeriens living and working along the migration route opposed the law, citing economic consequences.

The **United Arab Emirates** made preparations to use its position as [host](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/23/the-messier-the-world-gets-the-more-the-uae-seems-to-thrive) of the **COP28** climate summit, which opens in Dubai on Thursday, to negotiate oil-and-gas deals, according to the Centre for Climate Reporting and the BBC. Leaked briefing notes suggest that the UAE’s COP team wanted [Sultan al-Jaber](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/24/sultan-al-jaber-believes-cop28-can-find-a-new-way-forward-on-climate), who is both president of COP28 and head of Abu Dhabi’s national oil company, to discuss projects with foreign governments. A COP spokesperson said that the report is “inaccurate” and that the documents had not been used.

Two missiles were fired in the direction of the USS Mason, a **US Navy warship** in the Gulf of Aden, as it responded to a distress call of a tanker under attack by presumed Somali pirates. The missiles came from an area of Yemen controlled by the Iran-backed [Houthis](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/09/can-yemen-hold-together). It is the latest in a string of [Houthi attacks](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/25/the-three-steps-on-americas-ladder-of-military-escalation) on American interests.

**Merriam-Webster**, an American dictionary publisher, chose “authentic” as its **word of the year**. It attributed an increase in searches for the word to media stories about artificial intelligence, celebrity culture and social media. Other words which readers rushed to look up included “[indict](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/13/is-donald-trump-the-victim-of-a-witch-hunt)”, as popularised by Donald Trump’s legal travails, and “[coronation](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/05/04/britain-crowns-charles-iii-its-new-king)”, relating to the crowning of Britain’s King Charles III.

### An extended truce between Israel and Hamas

The calm will last at least a little longer. A [four-day truce](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/24/hamas-releases-24-hostages-including-13-israelis) between Israel and Hamas had been due to end on Tuesday morning. But Qatar, which has mediated talks between the warring parties, announced on Monday night that it would be extended for two days. Hamas confirmed the extension. That should also mean the release of at least 20 more hostages from Gaza, on top of the 50 expected to be freed in the first four days of the truce.

This is welcome news for civilians. Palestinians in Gaza will get a longer break from a brutal war, and more humanitarian aid will enter their beleaguered enclave. The families of the hostages in Israel will have renewed hope of seeing loved ones held captive for seven weeks. Still, the relief will [probably be short-lived](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/26/a-brutal-battle-for-southern-gaza-beckons-after-the-truce-ends). The truce will end, albeit later than expected. When it does, war will return to Gaza, and Hamas will still hold scores of hostages.

### NATO’s wobbles over Ukraine

Expect a glum meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels on Tuesday. Ukraine’s counter-offensive has [failed](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/the-war-in-ukraine-may-be-heading-for-stalemate) to break through Russian lines and Turkey is still [stalling over](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/10/why-is-turkey-blocking-sweden-from-joining-nato) Sweden’s membership. Worse, the mood in the West is turning against the long war. America rallied allies to help Ukraine, but its own military aid is running low. Republican [isolationists in Congress](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/23/the-sort-of-isolationist-case-for-backing-ukraine) are blocking new assistance. Nobody is sure when—or whether—aid will be restored.

As for Europeans, their arsenals and arms industries cannot quickly [take up the slack](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/with-crises-in-ukraine-and-israel-can-america-still-defend-taiwan) from America. And their politics are wobbly, too. The victory in the Netherlands of [Geert Wilders](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/24/who-is-geert-wilders-the-surprise-winner-of-the-dutch-election), whose far-right Freedom Party [won a plurality](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/23/geert-wilderss-election-win-leaves-the-dutch-in-an-awful-quandary), has sent a chill through NATO. He opposes arming Ukraine. Will the Netherlands abandon its tradition of staunch Atlanticism? The country could relinquish its leading role in supplying F-16 jets to Ukraine. Another casualty could be the hopes of the outgoing Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, to become the next NATO secretary-general.

### PDD Holdings reports earnings

When China’s e-commerce giants report their earnings, investors and economists look for more than just the financial results of individual companies. The sector has become a proxy for consumer demand, a part of the economy that has faltered somewhat since the pandemic. Disappointing results earlier this month from [Alibaba](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2013/03/23/the-alibaba-phenomenon) confirmed that household demand is still struggling.

This will no doubt be on investors’ minds on Tuesday, when PDD Holdings, another e-commerce outfit, reveals its numbers for the third quarter of the year. Some analysts think Pinduoduo, its Chinese unit, will do better than Alibaba. But PDD has more than just Chinese retail-sales intel to offer. Last year it launched Temu, an America-based app that exploded in popularity. Market watchers have been keen to see how well China’s consumer-tech groups can diversify away from that country’s slowing economy. An update on Temu will be a good gauge for that.

### WeWork works on its bankruptcy

On Tuesday a court in New Jersey will hear a motion filed by WeWork to end its leases on 69 buildings in cities including New York. The office-rental company [filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/07/the-fall-of-wework-shows-the-deepening-cracks-in-property) on November 6th. It is now trying to get out of costly and often long-term contracts. But landlords are pushing back. They say WeWork gave them only five days to respond to its requests for terminations, and are asking for more information about its credit lines.

The property industry is watching events in New Jersey closely, because the court’s decision will influence whether and how WeWork will be able to get out of hundreds of other leases, too. WeWork said it hopes to exit bankruptcy in around seven months. That is an ambitious goal. Achieving it will depend on how quickly the company resolves its disputes with numerous landlords.

### The uncertain fate of the Parthenon sculptures

If you cut the Mona Lisa in half and split it between Paris and London, would people still appreciate its beauty? So mused Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, when asked by the BBC about the [sculptures](https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/02/20/will-britain-lose-the-elgin-marbles) that Lord Elgin, a British diplomat, took from the Parthenon in the early 1800s. Mr Mitsotakis said the marbles should be returned to Greece. He was expected to make the same argument to his British counterpart, Rishi Sunak, at a meeting on Tuesday. But Mr Sunak reportedly did not like Mr Mitsotakis’s interview. He cancelled.

The Mona Lisa is an apt comparison. Until it was stolen in 1911, no one cared much about it: the Louvre did not notice it was missing for 26 hours. Similarly, the marbles fascinate partly because of their removal. Some argue that the British Museum is the safest place for them. The [recent theft](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/08/21/stealing-from-museums-is-easier-than-you-might-think) of around 2,000 items from its collection makes that claim less persuasive.
