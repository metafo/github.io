Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Israel’s** prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, rejected calls for a ceasefire, equating them with “calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas”. Meanwhile Israel continued an apparent advance on **Gaza city**, broadening its [ground offensive](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/29/israel-faces-agonising-choices-in-the-battle-for-gaza): Israeli armoured vehicles were reported on the north-south road running through the enclave. Israel claimed to have hit 600 Hamas targets in the past few days. It also repeated its call for Palestinians living in north Gaza to evacuate to the south. Doctors at the al-Quds hospital, which is in an area where air strikes have hit, said that would be impossible for patients. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said that more than 8,000 people have been killed since the war began.

**General Motors** struck a tentative agreement with United Auto Workers, the industry’s main union, to end a [six-week strike](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/27/joe-biden-may-come-to-regret-his-claim-to-be-pro-union). Around 18,000 workers from factories in Michigan, Missouri, Texas, and, since Saturday, Tennessee, had walked out to demand higher salaries. The other two of Detroit’s [“big three” carmakers](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/20/americas-big-car-firms-face-lengthy-strikes), Ford and Stellantis (whose largest shareholder part-owns *The Economist*’s parent company), clinched deals with the union in the past week.

Mr Biden signed **America’s** first-ever executive order on **artificial intelligence**. The sprawling legislation will [set parameters](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/24/the-world-wants-to-regulate-ai-but-does-not-quite-know-how) for the burgeoning technology in order to [protect consumers](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/02/the-relationship-between-ai-and-humans), [limit displacing workers](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/08/15/american-workers-v-technological-progress-the-battle-heats-up) and [stem racial bias](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/06/05/demographic-skews-in-training-data-create-algorithmic-errors). The government wants software companies to go beyond commitments to watermark AI-generated content, by sharing the results of pre-rollout safety tests with the government.

**Germany’s economy** shrank by 0.1% in the third quarter, following an expansion of 0.1% in the second quarter, according to revised data. That means [Europe’s largest economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/17/the-german-economy-from-european-leader-to-laggard) avoided a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth) earlier in the year. Inflation, which has [gnawed](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/17/is-germany-once-again-the-sick-man-of-europe) at the purchasing power of households, slowed to an annual rate of 3.8% in October.

A judge in Hong Kong adjourned a winding-up hearing for **Evergrande**, a heavily indebted Chinese property company, until December 4th. The firm must develop a new restructuring plan before then in order to avoid liquidation. [Evergrande](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/10/12/amid-turmoil-in-chinas-property-market-the-public-seethes) defaulted on its debts two years ago. Hui Ka Yan, its founder, was detained by Chinese police in September for unspecified crimes.

**HSBC** announced up to $3bn in additional share buybacks, lifting the total to $7bn this year. Noel Quinn, the chief executive, said higher interest rates had boosted profits. [The bank](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/02/20/hsbc-undergoes-yet-another-overhaul-it-still-may-not-be-enough) reported pre-tax profits of $7.7bn for the third quarter, though that was below analyst expectations of $8.1bn. Inflation pushed up the bank’s spending on technology and operations.

**Meta** will offer Facebook and Instagram users in Europe ad-free subscriptions from November. It will cost between €9.99 ($10.59) and €12.99 a month, with other fees being introduced from March. [Meta’s](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/26/ai-has-rescued-mark-zuckerberg-from-a-metaverse-size-hole) paid tiering addresses the [concerns of European regulators](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/08/24/how-europes-new-digital-law-will-change-the-internet) about its data-collection practices. Nothing will change for customers who do not mind their data being sold to advertisers.

### India’s IPO boom

In recent weeks India’s stockmarkets, like most around the world, have been roiled by the conflict in the Middle East. Investors will be hoping that the turmoil does not affect the country’s primary market, which is enjoying a bumper year. In the first nine months of 2023, there were 150 IPOs on Indian stock exchanges, accounting for 15% of global debuts, the highest share of any country, according to EY, a professional-services firm.

For many analysts, the boom reflects [India’s](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/26/lessons-from-frugal-businesses-minting-money-in-india) long-term growth potential. This week seven companies plan to go public; they include small firms in the food-processing and health-care sectors. The headliner, however, is Honasa Consumer, the parent company of Mamaearth, a big beauty-and-wellness brand. The firm is eyeing a valuation of 104bn rupees ($1.3bn) when it launches on Tuesday. But it may be brought down to earth. So far this year, smaller IPOs have outperformed those of larger companies.

### Social-media blocking at SCOTUS

On Tuesday America’s [Supreme Court](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/30/scotus-an-end-of-term-report) considers the pleas of people who say their First Amendment rights were violated by public officials who shunned them on Facebook. A city manager in Michigan blocked Kevin Lindke after tiring of his constituent’s “disparaging” comments during the covid-19 pandemic. Mr Lindke sued and lost. Yet a similar case in San Diego led to a different outcome. When two school-board members blocked Christopher and Kimberly Garnier, the couple prevailed in their legal challenge.

The split decisions present a quandary to the justices: when does a public official’s use of a social-media account constitute “state action”—the threshold for [freedom-of-speech infringement](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/05/at-american-law-schools-a-fresh-fuss-over-freedom-of-speech)? The matter hinges on whether the individuals were posting in an official capacity. The Garniers argue that the school-board members did indeed use their accounts to communicate with the community officially. But the city manager from Michigan warns that removing officials’ right to block would “chill the social-media speech of 21m public-sector employees”.

### Europe on the verge of recession

Many analysts feared the [European Union](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/12/our-european-economic-pentathlon) would fall into recession in 2022. Yet the expected downturn did not arrive. Russia’s war against Ukraine, an energy crisis and high inflation hit the bloc hard. But the economy was well-buffered: member states spent freely to soften the blow to incomes, order books were still full from the post-pandemic recovery and households had unspent savings from when restaurants were shut. Not any more. The EU’s and euro zone’s preliminary GDP figures for the third quarter, released on Tuesday, will probably indicate the start of a [recession](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/31/europes-economy-looks-to-be-heading-for-trouble).

A slowing global economy is hitting export-oriented economies like Germany’s; inflation has eaten into real incomes and state support is running out. Furthermore, interest rates are high, as a means to fight inflation—and are now hitting debtors in need of refinancing. Meanwhile the purchasing managers’ index for the euro zone recently dropped to a 35-month low. Those predicting recession were right—apart from the timing.

### King Charles in Kenya

Kenya is a special place for British royals. It was there that the future Queen Elizabeth II heard news of her father’s death in 1952. On Tuesday her eldest son, King Charles III, will begin a [four-day state visit](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/26/history-will-complicate-king-charless-visit-to-kenya), his first to an African or Commonwealth country since acceding to the throne last year. He will meet some of the entrepreneurs helping to make Kenya the most vibrant economy in the region, as well as Kenyan marines trained by their British counterparts.

For Kenyans, however, the visit of any British monarch raises questions over Britain’s colonial rule. Particularly painful memories surround the brutal suppression of the Mau Mau uprising in the 1950s, during which time thousands—if not tens of thousands—of Kenyans died. King Charles is set to acknowledge “wrongs suffered”. But his comments will almost certainly fall short of the demand by the Kenya Human Rights Commission, a local NGO, for an “unequivocal public apology”.

### Duran Duran’s Halloween album

Musicians often put out Christmas albums. But Duran Duran, a veteran British pop-rock outfit, have decided to release a record themed around a spookier holiday— Halloween. That may seem an unusual choice: Duran Duran are no goths. In their heyday in the 1980s they were known for their bright locks and sun-soaked videos.

But beneath the glossy veneer, the group always had a flair for the dramatic and sinister. The new album, “Danse Macabre”, shows off this darker side by reworking songs such as “Night Boat”, “Love Voodoo” and “Lonely In Your Nightmare” (wryly mashed up with Rick James’s “Super Freak”). It also includes covers of songs such as “Ghost Town”, a famously eerie track by The Specials, “Spellbound” by Siouxsie and the Banshees and “Bury A Friend” by Billie Eilish. Despite the gothic theme, “Danse Macabre” never takes itself too seriously. It has the effect of a superior party band playing at a jolly Halloween bash.
