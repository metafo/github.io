Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

[Hizbullah](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-hizbullah), a militia based in **Lebanon** and backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for firing rockets that hit the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona. ***Israeli\*** *planes bombed a house in Bint Jbeil in Lebanon, killing at least three people. Israel also shot down three aircraft that crossed the border.* The chief of Israel’s army, Herzi Halevi, said war will last “many months”, amid signs the conflict is spreading. Israel's Gaza offensive now appears to be focused on refugee camps in the centre of the territory, as well as the city of Khan Younis in the south.

**Wolfgang Schäuble**, a long-serving politician who was once tipped to become chancellor of Germany, died aged 81. A member of the Christian Democrats, Mr Schäuble first became interior minister in 1989 and helped guide the reunification of Germany. **Jacques Delors**, a former president of the European Commission, died on Wednesday, aged 98. Mr Delors drove the establishment of the EU single market and the treaty that led to the euro.

**Michigan’s** supreme court ruled that **Donald Trump** can remain on the state’s presidential primary ballot in 2024. The petitioners had sought to [remove](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/21/does-a-civil-war-era-ban-on-insurrectionists-apply-to-donald-trump) Mr Trump because of his role in the January 6th insurrection in 2021. A court in [Colorado](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/12/20/how-might-the-colorado-verdict-affect-donald-trumps-presidential-campaign) did disqualify Mr Trump from the ballot in that state, last week, though that decision has been paused to allow time for appeals.

The [*New York Times*](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/12/14/when-the-new-york-times-lost-its-way) sued **Microsoft** and **OpenAI**, the company that created [ChatGPT](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/04/14/chatgpt-could-replace-telemarketers-teachers-and-traders), for copyright infringement. Its lawsuit claims that millions of the publication’s articles were used unlawfully to train chatbots, amounting to “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages”. It is the latest swipe against AI platforms accused of using [copyrighted work](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/03/15/a-battle-royal-is-brewing-over-copyright-and-ai) to train their models.

An appeals court in **America** temporarily paused a ban on the import and sale of two types of **Apple** watch in the country. Apple is accused of infringing the copyright of Masimo, a medical-technology company, with its Series 9 and Ultra 2 models. America’s International Trade Commission provisionally blocked imports of the watches in October, forcing Apple to stop selling the popular watch brands last week.

**Lee Sun-kyun**, a South Korean star of the Oscar-winning film [**“Parasite”**](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/02/13/the-oscars-triumph-of-parasite), was found dead in Seoul. Mr Lee was being investigated for using illegal drugs, which carries harsh punishments in South Korea. Mr Lee insisted he was tricked into taking illegal substances and was being blackmailed. Police had questioned Mr Lee for 19 hours on Saturday.

**Japan’s** Nuclear Regulation Authority lifted its restrictions on restarting the world’s largest **nuclear-power plant**, [Kashiwazaki-Kariwa](https://www.economist.com/asia/2016/10/13/stop-start). It has been idle since 2011 when all of Japan’s reactors were shut down following the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident. Only a handful have been [restarted](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/12/japan-pivots-back-to-nuclear-power). The owner of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa still needs permission from local officials to turn the plant back on.

### 2024 in preview: Rich-world labour markets will remain strong

After the lifting of lockdowns in 2021, rich-world labour markets roared back to life faster than anyone had expected. In 2022 and 2023 they continued to strengthen, as consumers, flush with government stimulus payments and accumulated savings, and looking to make up for lost time, splurged on labour-intensive services. Total demand for labour across the rich world quickly outpaced the available supply of workers. The unemployment rate, at less than 5%, is at historical lows.

In 2024 expect rich-world labour labour markets to remain strong for several reasons. Demand and supply remain so out of whack that it would probably take a deep recession to truly damage jobs markets. Companies will also be more inclined to hoard workers, scarred by pandemic-era struggles to rehire those they let go during lockdowns. And as baby-boomers retire, the available pool of labour is shrinking fast. Whatever happens in 2024, finding a job will rarely have been so easy.

### 2024 in preview: A global minimum tax on firms

More than 130 countries struck a historic deal in 2021 that sought to change the way big companies are taxed. In 2024 it will at last start to have an impact. Several countries will begin implementing laws relating to a part of the agreement which aims to ensure no big firm pays tax at a rate of lower than 15% (an idea known as the “global minimum tax”). To do so, they will start collecting “top-up” taxes from companies which exploit tax havens.

But another part of the deal could fall apart next year. Governments have long complained about foreign tech giants that make profits in their markets through digital products, but do not set up local offices they can tax. The agreement granted governments a firmer right to tax such companies—which are mostly American. But America’s politicians are unwilling to grant foreigners more rights to tax its firms. This could lead to a tariff war between some 30 countries and America. Efforts to avoid such a costly skirmish will be fraught.

### 2024 in preview: The most indebted countries

Twenty years ago debt restructurings were a triumph of multilateralism. Governments and banks, watched over by the IMF, worked together to reduce the debts of countries that could no longer pay their bills. In return poor countries agreed to the kind of free-market reforms that had made their creditors prosper. An official “Heavily Indebted Poor Countries” plan made write-downs of huge swathes of debt relatively routine if not painless.

Not any more. In 2024 the disintegration of that system will continue. The world’s fragmenting geopolitics play out in miniature at each creditor meeting. China, the world’s largest bilateral creditor, refuses to play by Western financiers’ rules; stages that were once a bureaucratic formality now take months. It has been at least three years since Beijing agreed to a deal that writes down debts. Many poor countries will remain painfully stuck as relations between their lenders fray.

### 2024 in preview: Three commodities which could take off in 2024

In 2024 supply problems, together with resurgent demand, could cause three commodity markets to take off. The first is crude oil. Most analysts reckon that new supply will combine with slow economic growth to cause a gradual decline in price. But that could prompt Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest exporter, to announce deeper reductions in output than those—equivalent to 1% of global demand—it adopted in July. That could set the stage for a supply squeeze when economic growth returns.

Some metal markets also look vulnerable. The hottest of all could be the ultra-niche one for uranium. Decarbonisation and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine have made governments hungrier for atomic energy just as conflicts have disrupted uranium production.

The third commodity to watch is grain. Bumper crops from Russia have made up for the drop in Ukraine’s exports caused by the war. But bad weather and escalating tensions could jeopardise that. Global stocks have been falling for years. Buffers against shocks are slim.
