Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Vladimir Putin** announced he will seek another six-year term as **Russia’s** president ahead of elections set to take place next May. His bid for re-election was widely expected; in 2020 he changed Russia’s constitution to allow him to rule until 2036. Mr Putin, who has led Russia since 1999, is a shoo-in for victory—he has quashed all credible opposition.

The **UN Security Council** began a meeting to discuss the situation [in Gaza](https://web.archive.org/web/20231208183258/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/06/israel-is-pushing-into-southern-gaza-as-the-clock-ticks-down). Later on Friday it will vote on a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire. America, which has [veto powers](https://web.archive.org/web/20231208183258/https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/06/18/the-uns-structures-built-in-1945-are-not-fit-for-2020-let-alone-beyond-it) in the council, said it wouldn’t support such a motion. Earlier, Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, said there was a gap between **Israel’s** “intent to protect civilians” in **Gaza** and what it has been doing on the ground.

**Armenia** and **Azerbaijan** agreed to a prisoner exchange and to take steps toward normalising relations, marking significant progress toward ending a long conflict between the countries. Tensions flared in [September](https://web.archive.org/web/20231208183258/https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/19/azerbaijan-wants-to-reintegrate-nagorno-karabakh-through-force), when Azerbaijan took control of Nagorno Karabakh, an enclave that was mainly occupied by ethnic Armenians. The short war sparked a [mass exodus](https://web.archive.org/web/20231208183258/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/a-humanitarian-disaster-is-under-way-in-nagorno-karabakh) from the region.

**Nadia Calviño**, Spain’s finance minister since 2018, was appointed president of the **European Investment Bank**, the world’s largest multilateral lender. The EU institution finances large-scale projects across the bloc. Ms Calviño, who is also a deputy prime minister, was approved for the job by EU finance ministers on Friday. She will be the first woman to lead the bank.

America’s Department of Justice indicted **Hunter Biden** on nine tax-related charges, including failing to pay at least $1.4m in taxes. Mr Biden's lawyer accused David Weiss, who is leading the investigation into the [president's son](https://web.archive.org/web/20231208183258/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/11/hunter-bidens-woes-and-a-new-impeachment-saga-will-go-on-and-on), of bowing to Republican pressure. In October Mr Biden pleaded not guilty to a charge of lying on a form when buying a gun at a time when he was addicted to crack cocaine.

**Taiwan’s** exports rose by 3.8% year-on-year in November—their largest jump since July 2022, though still falling short of analysts’ expectations. The export-led economy has suffered from a drop in shipments of non-tech products, including chemicals and plastics. Earlier, **China** marked its first export growth since April—0.5% in November compared to a year ago—bringing some relief to Asian economies dragged down by its [economic slowdown](https://web.archive.org/web/20231208183258/https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/07/chinas-slowdown-is-rattling-asian-economies).

Swiss prosecutors closed one of the biggest **disputes** in **art market** history. Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch, had accused Yves Bouvier, a billionaire art dealer, of overinflating the value of art he sold him, including [works by Leonardo Da Vinci](https://web.archive.org/web/20231208183258/https://www.economist.com/prospero/2021/04/13/what-happened-to-the-salvator-mundi). The Russian launched various lawsuits against Mr Bouvier, but after a settlement was reached in Switzerland these have all been dropped or settled.

### Argentina gets a new president

[Javier Milei](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/13/sex-guru-cosplayer-economist-will-javier-milei-be-argentinas-next-president) will become the world’s first avowedly libertarian [head of state](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/11/23/javier-milei-will-be-argentinas-first-libertarian-president) on Sunday. The self-described “anarcho-capitalist” will take charge of an [economy in crisis](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/20/in-argentina-javier-milei-faces-an-economic-crisis). Annual inflation is currently 143%. There are more than 15 exchange rates and a morass of price, capital, import, and export controls. The actual fiscal deficit—obscured by government accounting trickery—[could](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/20/in-argentina-javier-milei-faces-an-economic-crisis) be as high as 10% of GDP.

Mr Milei has promised immediate shock reforms. His planned “omnibus law” may include deregulating the mining and energy sectors as well as privatising some state companies or transferring ownership to their employees. He will probably seek to slim the state, by simplifying the tax system and trimming the number of ministries. But those reforms require parliamentary assent. Mr Milei’s coalition holds only a tenth of seats in the Senate and 15% of seats in the lower house.

### Hong Kong’s closed-shop election

On Sunday Hong Kongers will vote on their representatives for District Councils, which play a marginal role in running the territory but have been seen as symbolic of public sentiment. It is the first time district elections have been held since 2019, when, following six months of protests, pro-democracy candidates won a landslide victory—and delivered [a powerful snub](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/11/25/voters-in-hong-kong-deliver-a-powerful-snub-to-beijing) to China. Hong Kong’s government is taking no chances this year. It has slashed the number of directly elected seats; only “patriots” are allowed to vie for the remainder.

Officials have called the closed-shop election the “last piece of the puzzle” in Hong Kong’s political transformation. China imposed a draconian national-security law on the territory in 2020, smothering dissent. The first “patriots-only” election for the Legislative Council was held in 2021, effectively wiping out opposition lawmakers. Hundreds of politicians, journalists and activists have been arrested. Turnout for the district-council election will be low. But that will not stop the government from using it to help bring the city to heel.

### To do good is Nobel

The Nobel prizes for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine and literature are all awarded at the city hall in Sweden’s capital, Stockholm. But, for reasons unknown, it was Alfred Nobel’s dying wish to have the peace prize presented by neighbouring Norway. This year’s party in Oslo, the capital, will honour [Narges Mohammedi](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/06/a-woman-described-as-irans-nelson-mandela-wins-the-nobel-peace-prize), an Iranian human-rights [activist](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/24/irans-women-prisoners-face-down-their-inquisitors). But she will not collect her prize in person (her two children will do so on her behalf).

Ms Mohammedi remains in a [notorious Iranian prison](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/18/irans-protests-spread-as-a-notorious-prison-burns) in Tehran, as defiant as ever. She refuses to wear the prison headscarf, even as it caused her to be denied a court hearing and medical treatment by the authorities. She has also smuggled out a letter thanking the Nobel committee for bolstering her resolve. Still, that of Iranians is waning. Many will watch the award ceremonies on foreign satellite channels. But after the regime crushed last year’s mass protests, the mood on the streets is that of despondency.

### The words of 2023

Come year-end, it is time for linguistic societies and dictionary publishers to name their Word of the Year. Oxford Dictionaries was razzed by the kids for picking “rizz”, which it glossed as “style, charm or attractiveness”, particularly the kind that helps someone land a romantic partner. Merriam-Webster, which bases its choice on frequency of lookups on its website, chose “authentic”.

But the year’s chatter was dominated by [artificial intelligence](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/generative-ai-will-go-mainstream-in-2024), and Collins Dictionary made a straightforward choice with “AI”. Cambridge Dictionary picked “hallucinate”, for text-producing [large language models’](https://www.economist.com/interactive/science-and-technology/2023/04/22/large-creative-ai-models-will-transform-how-we-live-and-work) habit of making things up.

The Johnson column in *The Economist* chose its own [word of the year](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/12/07/our-word-of-the-year-for-2023) from the field of AI. Perhaps controversially, it is a brand name, but it is the application that everyone was talking about in 2023, and one of the fastest growing websites of all time. It is the same in every language, and used generically to speak of text-based AIs. 2023 was undoubtedly the year of “ChatGPT”.

### Weekend profile: Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s strongman

As a child Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi believed that he was meant to be Egypt’s president. He had dreams in which he discussed such hopes with Anwar Sadat, a former ruler. Childhood friends say he was always dressed in a suit and tie. Mr Sisi fulfilled his ambitions in 2013, when he came to power in a military coup. When polls open for this year’s [elections](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/03/egypts-rushed-election-shows-abdel-fattah-al-sisi-is-nervous) on Sunday, with opposition suppressed, he will certainly win a third term.

Less clear is whether he always imagined becoming president by force. While studying at the United States Army War College in 2005, already a military commander, he wrote a thesis arguing for democracy in the Arab world. Then in 2011, after Mr Sisi was appointed director of military intelligence, Egyptians took to Tahrir Square to demand the resignation of Hosni Mubarak. After the [tyrannical president ](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2011/07/30/end-impunity-now)was removed from power, Mr Sisi was one of the military men temporarily put in charge of the country. When the Muslim Brotherhood’s Muhammad Morsi won the election in August 2012, Mr Sisi won his trust and was appointed the defence minister.

The camaraderie—and Mr Sisi’s supposed democratic convictions—did not last. When disillusioned Egyptians demanded Mr Morsi’s resignation in 2013, Mr Sisi ousted his one-time ally in a coup. Many Egyptians adored the military man—and welcomed the relative stability. But those that opposed him fared badly: that August Egyptian security forces killed about 1,000 protesters in Cairo. It set the tone for the next decade. Any shouts of dissent were aggressively stifled.

But the whispers are once again [getting louder](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/06/15/egyptians-are-disgruntled-with-president-abdel-fattah-al-sisi). The currency has been devalued three times since 2022, and another adjustment is on the way. External debt has more than doubled, from 17% of GDP in 2013, to 40.3% today. People cannot find money for food, with prices up by more than 70% in the past year. Instead of support, Mr Sisi offers his people lofty advice: “If the price of the nation’s progress and prosperity is hunger and thirst, then let us not eat or drink.” Egyptians also curse his handling of the Israel-Hamas war, saying he has not properly supported Palestinians. All of this worries Mr Sisi: he will win the election, but disgruntled Egyptians might not let him see out the term.
