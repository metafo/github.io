An **Israeli air strike** hit a crowded refugee camp in the north of the [Gaza Strip](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/30/why-urban-warfare-in-gaza-will-be-bloodier-than-in-iraq), the Israel Defence Forces confirmed. Officials at Indonesian hospital, near the [Jabalia camp](https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/10/17/israel-gaza-map-hamas-war), said that at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded. A spokesperson for the IDF said the strike targeted and killed Hamas militants, including Ibrahim Biari, one of the commanders of Hamas’s [October 7th attack](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas). Hamas denied that a senior commander had been in the area. As of July, the Jabalia camp hosted more than 116,000 Palestinian refugees. Meanwhile, Israeli forces advanced on Gaza city, pushing into a neighbourhood north of it, according to Gaza's interior ministry.

The **euro area’s GDP** shrank by 0.1% in the third quarter, as its [largest economies](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/12/our-european-economic-pentathlon) continue to be weighed down by high interest rates and low consumer demand. Following an expansion of 0.2% in the second quarter, analysts had expected stagnation. The flash estimate for the wider EU showed growth of 0.1%.

**Jacob Lew** will be **America’s** ambassador to **Israel**, after the Senate approved him in an expedited confirmation. Mr Lew, the Treasury secretary under Barack Obama, was nominated by Joe Biden for the post in September. His [confirmation](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/03/25/how-do-americas-senate-confirmations-work), which passed by a vote of 53 to 43, was opposed by Republicans critical of his role in authoring the [Iran nuclear deal](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/23/what-is-the-jcpoa-the-deal-meant-to-restrict-irans-nuclear-activity).

**Afghans** fled from **Pakistan** in droves ahead of a [deadline](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/10/12/pakistan-expels-undocumented-afghans-but-at-what-price) for roughly 1.7m undocumented [migrants](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/09/07/neighbours-fear-that-afghan-refugees-could-spark-civil-conflict) to leave the country. On Wednesday Pakistan’s government will begin arrests and deportations. Around 100,000 Afghans have already left in October; more than 10,000 crammed into buses and trucks heading for the border on Tuesday. Afghanistan’s Taliban government accused Pakistan of “harassment”.

A federal jury struck a blow to **American** **realtors** (called estate agents in Britain), finding big residential brokerages liable for $1.8bn in damages to home sellers for keeping [commission rates artificially high](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/08/29/why-americas-real-estate-brokers-are-such-a-rip-off). Plaintiffs’ lawyers argued that Americans pay twice as much in transaction fees as home buyers in comparable foreign markets. The National Association of Realtors, a defendant, vowed to appeal against the verdict.

After four months of negotiations, **Montenegro** finally appointed a [government](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/04/05/montenegros-long-time-boss-is-ousted), headed by Europe’s youngest prime minister, Milojko Spajic. The 36-year-old former finance minister said he wanted his country to be “the Switzerland of the Balkans and the Singapore of Europe”. First, he will need to tackle rife corruption and the country’s weak rule of law, as it [strives to join the EU](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/28/the-eu-is-finally-rebooting-the-enlargement-machine).

**Saudi Arabia** is set to host the men’s football **World Cup** in 2034 after its only likely challenger, Australia, pulled out hours before bidding ended. FIFA, football’s governing body, had said that the 2034 event would be held in Asia or Oceania. Saudi Arabia’s patchy human-rights record will make it a [controversial host](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/in-defence-of-qatars-hosting-of-the-world-cup).

### Correction: 

On October 28th we incorrectly stated that 14 countries, including America, abstained in a vote on the UN General Assembly’s resolution on Gaza. America was actually one of 14 countries that opposed the resolution; 45 others abstained. Sorry.

### Civilians and the battle for Gaza

The war in Gaza is taking a brutal toll on civilians. The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 8,500 people have [died](https://www.economist.com/interactive/the-economist-explains/2023/10/30/how-many-people-have-died-in-gaza)*.* On Tuesday an Israeli strike on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza killed at least 50 people, according to Palestinian medics at a nearby hospital. Urban warfare is especially destructive, but the Israel-Hamas conflict has specific characteristics that suggest that worse is yet to come.

Hamas has ruled Gaza for 16 years. It has embedded its military forces in civilian infrastructure to a high degree; targeting the former risks destroying the latter. Israel’s bombardment has also been intense by historical standards. It dropped 6,000 bombs in the first six days of the war, a rate far exceeding recent Western counter-terrorism campaigns. Many targets known to Israel before the war will now have been struck. Israeli jets will probably be moving to “dynamic” targeting—acting on intelligence developed relatively quickly. That increases the risk of civilian harm. Residents of Gaza have few safe places to flee.

### A summit to rein in AI

An elite bunch of 100 world leaders and tech executives will convene on Wednesday for a two-day “[safety summit](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/24/the-world-wants-to-regulate-ai-but-does-not-quite-know-how)” on artificial intelligence, hosted by Britain’s government. The venue is picturesque—Bletchley Park, a mansion north of London that hosted Britain’s secret code-breaking unit during the second world war. But amid such storied surroundings, attendees will face a tough question: how to ensure that [AI does not go rogue](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/20/how-to-worry-wisely-about-artificial-intelligence), or is not used in nefarious ways.

Their discussions may struggle to yield tangible outcomes. Yet the hope is that the delegates will at least endorse a code of conduct for AI-makers. Suggested measures could include requiring firms to have their models tested before release. Some might call for the creation of something akin to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which keeps the world abreast of research into global warming and develops ways to gauge its impact. More probably, the group will simply decide to meet again next year.

### Pakistan expels undocumented Afghans

Wednesday marks the deadline that Pakistan’s government set for [undocumented migrants to leave the country](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/10/12/pakistan-expels-undocumented-afghans-but-at-what-price)—or face expulsion. Most of those affected are Afghans: around 1.7m are believed to live in Pakistan without the right papers. Some fled after the Taliban retook power in Afghanistan in 2021. Yet others left their homeland decades ago or were born in Pakistan. Many Pakistanis blame Afghans for economic instability and the resurgence of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, a terrorist group linked to the Taliban. There has been an increase in TPP violence in Pakistan’s border regions in recent years.

Afghanistan faces a humanitarian crisis as it is. The Taliban will struggle to support a sudden influx of returnees. But the costs of the expulsion plan are high for Pakistan, too. There is now virtually no chance that the Taliban will agree to work with the country to restrain the TTP. And international dismay at the expulsions could complicate Pakistan’s effort to secure much-needed new funding from the IMF.

### The Fed takes a breather

Sometimes less is more. That will be the Federal Reserve’s guiding principle when it decides whether to raise interest rates on Wednesday, at the end of a regular meeting. The vast majority of investors expect the Fed to stand pat, keeping short-term rates unchanged with a floor of 5.25%. That would make it more than three months since its last increase, and its longest pause since early 2022. Indeed, rates may have reached their peak. The Fed’s next move, perhaps in mid-2024, is likely to be a cut.

The Fed still worries about inflation, not least because the economy has remained [so robust](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/29/americas-economy-is-booming-why-arent-its-bosses-happier). But financial markets have done much of its work by pushing long-term bond yields much higher recently, weighing on equity prices and raising borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. So long as the market is tightening itself, the Fed can stay on the sidelines.

### A Day of the Dead—for narcos

On Wednesday millions of Mexicans will visit cemeteries to celebrate the Day of the Dead. The tradition holds that the dead briefly come back to join the living. Families play music and decorate loved ones’ graves with orange *cempasúchil* flowers and [food](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/10/27/the-joys-of-pan-de-muerto-a-sweet-tribute-to-departed-loved-ones).

The celebrations will be especially extravagant in the Jardines del Humaya (Humaya Gardens), a burial site for Mexico’s drug gangs in the north-western state of Sinaloa. The cemetery’s flashy architectural style is known as “narcdeco”; the multi-storey mausoleums are larger than most Mexican homes. They include a mini Taj Mahal (pictured) and an imitation Greek temple. At least one has bulletproof-glass windows. Many have air-conditioning and Wi-Fi—incentives for relatives to visit.

Some feel the tombs glorify narcos and criticise Mexico’s government for not shutting down the cemetery. But the power of the drug lords is so entrenched in the region that there is little chance of closure.
