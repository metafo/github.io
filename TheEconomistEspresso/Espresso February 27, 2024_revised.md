Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Hungary’s parliament voted to allow Sweden to join NATO. Sweden applied to join the alliance just under two years ago, but faced opposition from Turkey and Hungary. The vote came after Sweden agreed on February 23rd to lease more fighter jets to the country. [Viktor Orban](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/01/31/can-anyone-do-anything-about-viktor-orban), Hungary’s prime minister, had ostensibly objected to ratification because of Sweden’s criticism of his policies.

Muhammad Shtayyeh, the Palestinian Authority’s prime minister, submitted the resignation of his government to Mahmoud Abbas, the president. Mr Shtayyeh said that he made the decision because of “developments related to the aggression” against [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/22/the-wrecking-of-gazas-health-system-goes-beyond-its-hospitals) and the escalation of violence in the West Bank. Mr Abbas has been under international pressure to [beef up the PA](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/25/can-the-palestinian-authority-be-beefed-up), which America wants to help govern Gaza after the war.

An ally of Alexei Navalny said that plans to swap [the Russian opposition leader](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/22/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity) for a prisoner in Germany were in “final stages” when Mr Navalny [died](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/22/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity) on February 16th. Maria Pevchikh said she believed Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, had Mr Nalvany killed to sabotage the deal, in which Mr Navalny and two American citizens would be exchanged for a former Russian intelligence officer.

Microsoft will allow Mistral, a [ten-month-old French startup](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/26/meet-the-french-startup-hoping-to-take-on-openai), to make available its artificial-intelligence models on Azure, the American firm’s high-margin cloud business. The “strategic partnership” will also see Microsoft take an undisclosed stake in Mistral. The tech giant has invested $13bn in OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT. That deal is under scrutiny by regulators in America and Britain.

America’s trustbuster sued to block a planned $25bn takeover by Kroger, a major supermarket, of its smaller rival, Albertsons. The Federal Trade Commission, which has been [aggressively pursuing](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/13/american-trustbusters-are-losing-their-focus) big deals, says the merger would lead to higher prices and threaten employees’ wages. Kroger insisted that the FTC’s decision would harm consumers; Albertsons said it would strengthen grocery giants such as Walmart.

Israel reportedly killed two Hizbullah members in Baalbek, a city in eastern Lebanon, in response to the downing of an Israeli drone on Monday. Israel’s air force also hit infrastructure used by the [Iran-backed militant group](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-hizbullah). The strike was Israel’s deepest attack in Lebanese territory since the Hamas attacks on October 7th.

Maryam Nawaz, the daughter of Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister of Pakistan, was elected as the chief minister of Punjab. Her win was widely expected after Mr Sharif’s party took power at the head of a coalition government, following a [contentious election](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/02/12/pakistans-voters-tell-the-generals-where-to-put-it) on February 8th. Supporters of [Imran Khan](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2024/01/04/imran-khan-warns-that-pakistans-election-could-be-a-farce), the jailed former prime minister, boycotted the vote.

### Correction: 

An earlier edition of The World in Brief described a renewable-energy project in Gujarat as the world’s largest solar park. It is in fact a hybrid wind and solar facility. Sorry.

### What Michigan’s primary will reveal

On Tuesday voters in Michigan go to the polls in the state’s presidential primary election. Joe Biden and Donald Trump will surely prevail in the Democratic and [Republican contests](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/25/why-nikki-haley-crushed-in-her-home-state-vows-to-fight-on) respectively. But observers will be watching for clues about what might happen in the swing state in November’s general election.

Democrats fear that the war in Gaza is costing Mr Biden votes. Michigan has one of the largest Arab-American populations in the country. Several Democratic politicians, including Rashida Tlaib, who represents much of Detroit in the House, have asked voters to say they are “uncommitted” instead of voting for the president.

For Republicans, questions surround the chaotic condition of the local party. This primary will, in fact, assign less than a third of the state’s 55 delegates who will select the Republican nominee. The rest will be awarded at a convention in early March. But the state Republican Party is torn by infighting and is reportedly in dire financial straits, so the process could be a mess.

### Europe’s plan for more arms

On Tuesday the European Commission will unveil plans to boost [arms and ammunition production](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/14/can-europe-arm-ukraine-or-even-itself). The European Defence Industrial Strategy will probably aim high. Ukrainian forces are [on the back foot](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/02/21/is-ukraine-losing-the-war-against-russia) against Russia and help from America looks uncertain as a $61bn military-aid package remains stuck in Congress.

One goal of the EU’s plan will be to incentivise big cross-border investments in defence. Thierry Breton, the bloc’s internal-market commissioner, would also like EU members to jointly develop new cyber and space capabilities, as well as hypersonic air defence and, in time, an aircraft carrier.

Still, giving Ukraine what it needs will be a challenge. Josep Borrell, the bloc’s foreign-policy chief, recently admitted that the EU would only be able to provide around half of 1m artillery shells that it had promised to send by March. There is also a political gap between EU countries near Russia, which want to increase defence spending more urgently, and the bigger, richer ones farther away.

### Polish farmers march on Warsaw

For weeks Polish farmers have disrupted transport across Poland, blocking main roads, ports and railways on the border with Ukraine. On Tuesday the protests are ramping up as farmers bring their ire to Warsaw, the capital.

[Farmers across Europe](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/01/europes-grumpy-farmers-are-a-symptom-of-wider-malaise) have been protesting against the European Union’s green legislation, which pushes for limits on the use of chemicals and ambitious caps on greenhouse-gas emissions. Polish farmers have another concern on their doorstep: cheap imports from Ukraine. The EU lifted grain duties in 2022 to help Ukraine’s war-battered economy. Polish farmers say they cannot compete.

That is a headache for Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister, who has sought to present his new government as more co-operative with the EU. But he is also reluctant to antagonise the farmers ahead of local elections in April. The raised pitchforks and road-blocking tractors only make the balancing act harder.

### The challenges of the energy transition

On Tuesday climate scientists, policymakers and business leaders gather in London for International Energy Week. The focus of the discussions will be the tricky process of [transitioning away](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/13/in-a-first-cop28-targets-the-root-cause-of-climate-change) from fossil fuels. Comprehensively switching to renewables will bring significant challenges. The output of wind and solar energy sources is highly variable compared with fossil fuels, the supply of which is more controllable. That makes planning for fluctuations in supply and demand harder.

The three-day conference will consider ways to [modify energy systems](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2023/04/05/the-electric-grid-is-about-to-be-transformed) to that end, including by utilising artificial intelligence. The process of transforming and expanding power infrastructure is accelerating at pace. For instance, in Gujarat, a state in western India, a vast hybrid wind-solar park was recently connected to the grid. It will eventually be the size of Singapore and, it is hoped, will provide enough power for 18m homes.

### A new adaptation of “Shogun”

“Shogun” was a best-selling novel by James Clavell, a British writer, published in 1975. It told the story of John Blackthorne, an English sailor, who is marooned in a fishing village in “the Japans” at the end of the 16th century. He encounters Lord Toranaga Yoshi (inspired by [Tokugawa Ieyasu](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/23/keeping-up-with-the-tokugawas), the founder of the last shogunate) as civil war looms. The book, and a television adaptation from 1980, caused a sensation in the West by introducing a new generation to Japanese culture.

Now FX, a subsidiary of Disney, has made a new version for television, released on Tuesday. Its treatment of the plot and lavish visuals are impressive. It also adapts the story to the sensitivities of the 21st century. In the series from 1980, the Japanese characters were largely secondary—their intermittent dialogues in their native tongue were not even translated. In the FX series, however, the Japanese is subtitled, and the characters are portrayed with depth. That, the showrunner suggests, endows it with a “spirit of common respect” between East and West.
