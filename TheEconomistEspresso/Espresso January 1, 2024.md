**Maersk**, a Danish shipping giant, again paused sailings through the [**Red Sea**](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101002255/https://www.economist.com/business/2023/12/19/attacks-on-shipping-in-the-red-sea-are-a-blow-to-global-trade) after Iran-backed **Houthi** rebels from Yemen attacked another of its container ships. Many shipping firms [suspended](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101002255/https://www.economist.com/business/2023/12/19/attacks-on-shipping-in-the-red-sea-are-a-blow-to-global-trade) routes through the sea in December; Maersk only resumed sailing on the 24th. On Saturday militants tried to hijack the *Maersk Hangzhou*; on Sunday American navy helicopters destroyed the Houthis’ attack vessels.

Binyamin Netanyahu, **Israel’s** prime minister, said his country’s war in **Gaza** will continue “for many more months” and vowed to take control of the border between the enclave and Egypt. He also warned that [Hizbullah](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101002255/https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-hizbullah), and its backer Iran, will “receive blows” if it expands its assault on northern Israel from Lebanon. Meanwhile, Israeli forces continued their [bombardment](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101002255/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/29/the-year-everything-and-nothing-changed-in-the-middle-east) of Gaza, especially targeting Khan Younis, a southern city.

**Queen Margrethe II of Denmark** unexpectedly announced her **abdication** after 52 years on the throne. She disclosed her decision live on television during her annual New Year’s Eve speech. When she steps down on January 14th Queen Margrethe, who has also worked as a [set designer](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101002255/https://www.economist.com/1843/2016/04/21/hamlet-comes-home), will be succeeded by her elder son. He will become King Frederik X.

**Congo’s** election commission declared that **Félix Tshisekedi** had been re-elected the country’s president in a vote on December 20th, with 73% of the ballots cast. It put the turnout at more than 43%. The opposition called the [chaotic vote](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101002255/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/18/why-congos-chaotic-election-matters), which was plagued with [problems](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101002255/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/20/for-congos-next-president-winning-may-be-the-easy-part), including the issuance of millions of invalid voter cards, a “sham”. Mr Tshisekedi is due to be sworn in on January 20th.

**Ukrainian** officials said that **Russia** launched drone strikes on Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The attacks began hours after Ukraine shelled Belgorod, a Russian city near the Ukrainian border, killing 24 people, according to Russian authorities. Russia’s defence ministry said that the attacks “would not go unpunished”.

Two weeks before Taiwan’s [presidential election](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101002255/https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-taiwan-election) **China’s** leader, **Xi Jinping**, declared that the island’s “[reunification](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101002255/https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/03/06/taiwan-is-a-vital-island-that-is-under-serious-threat)” with the mainland was “inevitable”. Taiwan’s relationship with China dominated a debate among presidential candidates earlier on Sunday. Lai Ching-te, the front-runner, who once described himself as a “pragmatic worker for Taiwan independence”, said he was willing to “conduct exchanges and co-operation with China”.

The **UN’s** peacekeeping mission in **Mali** was due to finish its withdrawal on Sunday. The country’s military government had asked the mission’s 12,000 troops, and other staff, to [clear out](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101002255/https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/its-going-to-get-grimmer-in-the-sahel) by the end of the year. The government has blamed the UN for failing to stop a jihadist insurgency. The head of the UN’s mission admitted that it had fallen short of expectations.

### 2024 in preview: The decarbonisation of industrial activities

Greenhouse-gas emissions by heavy industry, which along with the power sector is the biggest global net emitter, have so far escaped serious regulation. That is because industry is difficult and expensive to decarbonise. But in 2024 the first shots of a “brown-to-green” revolution will be fired.

There are several reasons for the shift. First, technology is improving. Cement, for instance, can now be made with less “clinker” (a carbon-intensive input). Second is policy: 2024 will reveal if the EU’s effort to impose carbon border adjustment taxes will take hold. If it does, America may introduce a similar system. This would encourage companies around the world to decarbonise in order to retain access to big markets. Finally, there has been a shift in global finance. Many investors, in reaction to the excesses of “ESG” activism, which called on them to spurn legacy industries, are shifting to a more pragmatic approach. The decarbonisation of heavy industry will require trillions of dollars, but the wheels are turning at last.

### 2024 in preview: China will take the lead in the car industry

In 2024 China will become the world’s largest [car exporter](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/evs-are-poised-to-make-china-the-worlds-biggest-car-exporter) for the first time. Its lead in battery-making is crucial. Countries are promoting sales of electric vehicles and trying to eliminate carbon-dioxide-spewing combustion engines.

China’s government has been supporting electric-vehicle manufacturing and adoption for longer than its rivals. The majority of battery factories, existing and planned, are in China. Although China’s market share will drop slightly by 2030, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a firm of analysts, estimates that China will still have 69% of global battery-production capacity (enough to make 90m cars a year).

This is compared with just 14% (19m cars) each for Europe and America, which have only recently started to catch up thanks to new support from their governments. Subsidies mean they will probably have sufficient battery-production capacity to cover domestic demand for EVs by 2030. But no matter how much America and Europe spend, China’s battery dominance will last for the foreseeable future.

### 2024 in preview: Generative AI will go mainstream

In 2024 expect companies outside the technology sector to start adopting generative AI with the aim of cutting costs and boosting productivity. There are three reasons why AI will [go mainstream](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/generative-ai-will-go-mainstream-in-2024).

First, large companies spent much of 2023 experimenting with generative AI. Plenty of firms are using it to write the first drafts of documents, from legal contracts to marketing material. Now they are planning to deploy it on a larger scale. Second, more AI products will hit the market. In 2023 venture-capital investors poured some $36bn into generative AI, more than twice as much as in 2022. The third reason is talent. Although AI gurus are still in high demand, the market is easing. A survey by McKinsey, a consultancy, reported that firms are finding it easier to hire for AI-related roles. But using the technology is not without risks. Managers worry about valuable data leaking out through AI tools. It will be data-savvy firms that benefit first.

### 2024 in preview: The fight to control the headset market

The most eagerly awaited gadget of 2024 is Apple’s Vision Pro, a sleek headset that combines virtual reality with “mixed reality”. It uses front-mounted cameras to show the user a live video-feed of the outside world, onto which computer graphics can be superimposed. Apple calls it the most ambitious product it has ever made. It will be competing for consumers’ attention with various [rivals](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/the-fight-to-control-the-headset-market-will-intensify), chief among them Quest 3, a far cheaper headset sold by Meta.

But don’t expect any headset to take the world by storm just yet. Worldwide sales of video headgear will grow by a third in 2024, but will total only 18m units, forecasts Omdia, a market-research company. (Smartphone sales will exceed 1bn.) The thing to watch in 2024 is what developers find to do with the devices. Most people still have no strong reason to use headsets, which appeal mostly to gamers. But as programmers begin to play around with the Vision Pro, that could change.
