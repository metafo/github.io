A ship is expected to set sail from Cyprus this weekend to deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza, opening a long-trailed humanitarian corridor to the Palestinian enclave. The vessel will drag a barge containing 200 tonnes of food provided by an American charity, but it is unclear where it will dock once it reaches the Gaza Strip. Yesterday America said it would take 60 days to build a [pier designed to receive aid shipments off Gaza’s coast](https://web.archive.org/web/20240309172025/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/08/will-joe-bidens-new-plan-bring-relief-to-gaza). America has been air-dropping food in the territory since March 2nd, a move that has been criticised as inefficient and dangerous.

Asif Ali Zardari was voted president of Pakistan by the country’s parliamentarians. He was supported by the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, two parties that formed a coalition government after last month’s [controversial general election](https://web.archive.org/web/20240309172025/https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/02/12/pakistans-voters-tell-the-generals-where-to-put-it). Mr Zardari’s term, which begins on Sunday, will be his second. His first, from 2008 to 2013, took place in the aftermath of the assassination of his wife, Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan’s first female prime minister.

The Houthis launched a [mass drone attack](https://web.archive.org/web/20240309172025/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/04/why-yemens-houthis-are-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea) on a merchant ship in the Gulf of Aden and sent more drones towards American warships in the Red Sea. The American navy, which has been patrolling the waterways to defend merchant shipping since November, said it shot down 15 of the drones. The Houthis, a rebel group that controls a large swathe of Yemen, claim to be acting in support of Palestinians.

Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s Taoiseach, acknowledged defeat in a two-part referendum about modernising the constitution. With the support of other parties, his government had sought to expand the definition of families to include “durable relationships”, not just those founded on marriage. And it wanted to change a reference to a mother’s “duties in the home” to one about family-based care. Formal results are expected later on Saturday.

OpenAI said Sam Altman would return to its board. Mr Altman, the AI startup’s co-founder and boss, was fired from its board in November over allegations that he misled investors. An independent investigation into the ousting found no evidence of wrongdoing. Bret Taylor, OpenAI’s chairman, described the [chaotic episode](https://web.archive.org/web/20240309172025/https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/19/the-sam-altman-drama-points-to-a-deeper-split-in-the-tech-world) as “simply a breakdown in trust”.

Gangs in Haiti [attacked several government buildings](https://web.archive.org/web/20240309172025/https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/03/07/the-last-scraps-of-the-haitian-state-are-evaporating), including the presidential palace, in Port-au-Prince, the capital. The gangs are demanding the resignation of the unpopular prime minister, Ariel Henry, who has not returned to the country since travelling to Kenya last week. Guy Philippe, a former police chief who led a coup in 2004, made a claim for the presidency and told Mr Henry to step down.

Ukrainian drones struck Kursk and Rostov, two Russian regions that adjoin Ukraine’s eastern border, according to the local Russian governors. The attacks typify Ukraine’s growing willingness to strike back in response to Russia’s myriad drone launches. In early January Russia said it intercepted 36 over Crimea. Ukraine’s government has said it hopes to make 10,000 long-range drones in 2024.

### A testing Ramadan begins in Gaza

Ramadan begins at sundown on Sunday. But despite guarded optimism in the past few weeks about a break in the fighting in Gaza, the Muslim holy month may not bring that respite. America’s president, Joe Biden, had hoped to announce a ceasefire in his state-of-the-union speech on Thursday. Instead he announced a [plan to build a pier off Gaza’s coast](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/08/will-joe-bidens-new-plan-bring-relief-to-gaza) to receive shipments of humanitarian aid.

This will not immediately alleviate the growing hunger in Gaza. Even if work begins this weekend, it will take weeks for the pier to be ready. Meanwhile, Egyptian and Qatari brokers still hold out hope that talks in Cairo could yield a six-week truce and the release of Israeli hostages, now held in Gaza for over five months. But many issues remain unresolved, including that of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the positioning of Israeli troops in Gaza during a potential ceasefire.

### Portugal’s sensible election

A fallen prime minister, snap elections, a fragmented party system and an ascendant hard-right. It sounds like a formula for instability. Yet Portugal’s general election on Sunday will probably allow the traditional political parties to stay in power.

Antonio Costa headed a stable majority government until an [influence-peddling scandal](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/07/portugals-prime-minister-resigns-over-a-corruption-scandal) broke in November. He stepped down, denying wrongdoing, to fight the charges. The new prime minister will be either Mr Costa’s fellow Socialist, Pedro Nuno Santos, or Luis Montenegro of the centre-right Social Democrats.

Polls say Mr Montenegro may come first, though the left-wing parties taken together may do better than the right-leaning ones. The populist new-right Chega could double its vote from the last election in 2022. But other parties have promised not to work with it. The most likely scenario is a wobbly centrist government that the other side will reluctantly vote for to keep Chega out.

### The Oscars go global

In 2020 [“Parasite”](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2020/02/10/parasite-becomes-the-first-foreign-language-film-to-win-best-picture), a South Korean film, became the first foreign-language feature to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, breaking what its director, Bong Joon-ho, called the “one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles”. Every year since, an international, foreign-language title has been nominated for the top prize. This year, for the first time, there are two: “Anatomy of a Fall” (France) and “The Zone of Interest” (Britain/Poland). “Past Lives”, an American production chiefly in Korean, is also on the shortlist. Another first: not one nominee in the documentary category is American.

The increasingly international character of the Oscars reflects the Academy’s efforts to become more diverse and global. In 2015 a hashtag, [#OscarsSoWhite](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2016/01/21/how-racially-skewed-are-the-oscars), drew attention to its predominantly white membership. The share of members from underrepresented races and ethnicities has since doubled. The body’s international membership has risen to around 20%. “Oppenheimer” is odds-on to win Best Picture. But whoever takes home Hollywood’s holy grail, international cinema has already won.

### The growing popularity of South Asian music

This weekend the Southbank Centre in London is filled with the sounds of the sitar, sarod and tabla. At South Asian Sounds, a festival that reaches its climax on Sunday, some of the region’s finest musicians take centre stage. The programme spans several genres, from Indian classical music and folk song to experimental jazz.

London is a fitting location for such a celebration: around 20% of the city’s residents have South Asian heritage. Yet the festival also points to a growing global audience for the region’s music. Last year Diljit Dosanjh became the first Indian artist to perform at Coachella, an American music festival. In 2022 “Pasoori”, a song by Ali Sethi, a Pakistani-American musician, and Shae Gill, a Pakistani singer, became the most-searched track in the world after it featured in “Ms Marvel”, a TV show. Western artists still dominate the global music industry. But South Asians are finding a place on the playlist.

### Jensen Huang, shovel-maker for the AI gold rush

Jensen Huang is a paranoid man. The boss of Nvidia, an American chip designer, is fond of saying that his company is always “30 days away from going out of business”. Recent developments, however, are making a mockery of such talk. Thanks to an artificial-intelligence (AI) boom, [Nvidia is now America’s third-most valuable firm](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/27/why-do-nvidias-chips-dominate-the-ai-market). Its market capitalisation of $2.2trn is only exceeded by Microsoft and Apple.

Mr Huang’s paranoia can be traced back to his roots. After his family moved from Taiwan to America he was sent to a Baptist school for troubled youths. There, he shared a room with a knife-scarred boy. That did little to distract him from academic success: he sped through high school, graduating at 16. In 1993, aged 30 and armed with two degrees in electrical engineering, he founded Nvidia with two other engineers. The start-up had to compete in a cut-throat semiconductor market dominated by heavyweights like Intel, then the world’s biggest chipmaker.

Beyond paranoia, two further traits explain how Mr Huang has propelled Nvidia to success. The first is a focus on the long term. He realised early on that simply making fast chips was not enough: customers also needed help in tailoring them for their specific needs. In the mid 2000s he started investing in “CUDA”, a software platform that enables Nvidia’s customers to make the most of its chips. Many saw software development as a costly distraction for a chip company. But today CUDA is one of the company’s strongest defences against competitors.

The second is Mr Huang’s propensity for bold bets. Almost a decade ago he realised that Nvidia’s graphics-processor units, which were originally built for video-game consoles, also worked well for training AI models. Mr Huang shifted his company’s resources towards building chips for AI applications, long before the current boom in large language models. In 2017 he surprised investors by saying that the company’s transition to AI could “work out great, or terribly” since the firm was “all in”. Even for Mr Huang, great would be an understatement.
