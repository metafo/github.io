Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Hamas** released 13 Israeli and four Thai hostages late on Saturday, the second day of a [four-day truce](https://web.archive.org/web/20231126075540/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/22/israel-strikes-a-hostage-deal-but-promises-the-gaza-war-isnt-over) with **Israel**, after a delay of several hours. Thirty-nine Palestinians were freed from Israeli prisons. Hamas had held up the release, claiming that Israel had breached the terms of the truce: fewer aid trucks had reached northern Gaza than agreed on, a spokesman said. Israel denied breaking its word. A first set of 24 hostages and 39 prisoners were freed on [Friday](https://web.archive.org/web/20231126075540/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/24/hamas-releases-24-hostages-including-13-israelis).

A container ship owned by an Israeli-controlled company was reportedly hit by an **Iranian** drone on Friday, according to American officials. The explosion damaged the Malta-flagged vessel in the Indian Ocean but no one was injured. Earlier this week Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis seized an Israeli-linked ship in the Red Sea. [Israel](https://web.archive.org/web/20231126075540/https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas) called that an “Iranian act of terror”.

**Ukraine** has a “deficit of air defence”, which it needs to protect grain-export routes, said Volodymyr Zelensky at an international summit on food security in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. His address followed Russia’s largest drone attack of the war, which injured five people early on Saturday ; officials claimed that almost all the 75 Iranian-designed[ drones](https://web.archive.org/web/20231126075540/https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/24/ukraines-allies-are-scrambling-to-bolster-its-air-defences) deployed had been shot down.

**Geert Wilders** vowed to eventually become prime minister of the **Netherlands** on X (formerly Twitter), following the[ surprise victory](https://web.archive.org/web/20231126075540/https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/23/geert-wilderss-election-win-leaves-the-dutch-in-an-awful-quandary) for his anti-Muslim, anti-immigration, anti-EU Party for Freedom in elections on Wednesday. The PVV is forecast to take just 25% of parliamentary seats, meaning it needs to co-operate with two moderate parties to form a government. On Friday the VVD Party refused to form a cabinet with it.

**China** and **America** traded accusations after China’s army said it had to “warn away” an American warship in the disputed [South China Sea](https://web.archive.org/web/20231126075540/https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-us-destroyer-entered-its-territorial-waters-without-permission-2023-11-25/). America said the ship had “asserted navigational rights… consistent with international law”. China claims almost all of the South China Sea, despite an arbitral tribunal at The Hague ruling it had no basis in law in 2016.

**Derek Chauvin**, the Minneapolis police officer convicted of the murder of [George Floyd](https://web.archive.org/web/20231126075540/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/04/22/derek-chauvin-is-found-guilty-of-murder), was reportedly stabbed in federal prison. The Federal Bureau of Prisons said that an inmate was stabbed and transported to the local hospital on Friday, but did not confirm his identity. In 2020 the policeman restrained Floyd by kneeling on his neck. The killing sparked civil-rights demonstrations across America.

**Mexican** scientists launched a campaign to raise funds for the conservation of the axolotl, a critically endangered salamander native to the country. The programme—dubbed “Adoptaxolotl”—allows donors to adopt one of the “water monsters” for about $35. The population density of Mexican axolotls has declined by more than 99% in less than 20 years, according to the scientists.

### India and Israel draw closer

On Sunday India marks 15 years since gunmen from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistani terrorist group, killed 166 people in a four-day rampage in Mumbai, the commercial capital. The co-ordinated attacks included one on a Jewish community centre, where the terrorists murdered six Jews. Last week, to mark the sombre anniversary, Israel designated LeT a terrorist organisation.

The declaration is the latest sign of [growing co-operation](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/02/narendra-modi-has-shifted-india-from-the-palestinians-to-israel) between the countries. Over the past decade India has bought missiles, drones and border-security equipment from Israel, making it the Israeli defence industry’s biggest foreign customer. The two sides have also bonded over their shared dedication to fighting Islamist terrorism. Once sympathetic to the Palestinians’ plight, India abstained from a UN resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Its stance has disappointed the leaders of India’s 200m Muslims. But Narendra Modi, the prime minister, scarcely cares. His Bharatiya Janata Party has won votes from middle-class Hindus by offending India’s Muslim minority. With a general election scheduled next year, Mr Modi is unlikely to change tack.

### China, Japan and South Korea hold talks

On Sunday South Korea will host the foreign ministers of China and Japan in Busan, a city on its south-eastern coast. It is the first meeting among the countries’ top diplomats in four years. Ambitions to hold annual trilateral summits, first stated in 2008, faded owing to regional tensions and the covid-19 pandemic. Now the ministers hope to pave the way for a leaders’ meeting at the “earliest convenient time”.

China is concerned that its neighbours are [improving their relations with one another](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/04/americas-closest-indo-pacific-allies-are-cosying-up), which could change the power balance in the Indo-Pacific. Relations between Japan and South Korea were long strained by bickering over Japan’s colonial-era atrocities. But Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea’s president since 2022, has largely put this issue aside. That has also helped both countries to become closer to America. In August President Joe Biden [hosted](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/10/why-joe-biden-will-host-japan-and-south-koreas-leaders-at-camp-david) Mr Yoon and Kishida Fumio, Japan’s prime minister, for the first-ever standalone summit among the three countries’ leaders. China has been paying attention—and pushing to restart its own high-level talks.

### F1 has a boredom problem

Two years ago, before the Formula 1 season’s 22nd and final race in Abu Dhabi, Max Verstappen of Red Bull and Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes were locked together on the same number of points. A controversy over the handling of the safety car resulted in Mr Verstappen, on a newer set of tyres, overtaking Sir Lewis on the last lap to take the title. The result stood despite Mercedes’s loud protests.

Since then Mr Verstappen has seen Sir Lewis and the rest of the grid disappear into his mirrors. In 2022 he won an unprecedented 15 races. This year, he has already broken his own record, taking 18 of the 21 so far. Sunday’s season-closer, again in Abu Dhabi, will thus be little more than a victory lap for Mr Verstappen’s bullish team. Formula 1’s owners will be [hoping that a challenger](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/20/max-verstappens-brilliance-is-hurting-formula-one) might emerge in 2024 to keep the action exciting.

### The boost of the Booker prize

When the Booker prize judges announce their choice for the best English-language novel of the past year on Sunday, there is a 50% chance the author’s name is “Paul”. Paul Harding, Paul Lynch and Paul Murray are all shortlisted, alongside Sarah Bernstein, Jonathan Escoffery and [Chetna Maroo](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/18/quiet-artworks-sometimes-make-the-deepest-impressions). Bookmakers have Mr Lynch’s “Prophet Song” as the frontrunner: a dystopian tale in which Ireland is governed by a totalitarian regime. But it would be foolhardy to write off Mr Murray’s “The Bee Sting”, an account of one family’s dysfunction, told from multiple perspectives.

The triumphant author will get £50,000 ($62,000) as well as a huge publicity boost. Shehan Karunatilaka’s [“The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/18/shehan-karunatilaka-returns-with-another-thrilling-satire) had sold 3,000 hardback copies before it won the [prize in 2022](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/06/these-are-the-economists-best-books-of-2022); in the subsequent months, that figure soared to 70,000 (alongside 50,000 paperbacks). Literary prizes may involve intangible factors, but the “Booker bump” is a real-world phenomenon.

### Weekend profile: Sam Altman, AI’s poster child

It is hard to think of a tech company that has had a more exciting year than OpenAI, the artificial-intelligence firm behind ChatGPT. For most of 2023 it looked like a highly successful firm whose technology was [shaking up the world](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/28/investors-are-going-nuts-for-chatgpt-ish-artificial-intelligence). On November 17th the company itself was shaken up when its board suddenly sacked Sam Altman, its co-founder and CEO. After his staff and the firm’s investors rallied for his return, Mr Altman was [quickly reinstated](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/22/the-fallout-from-the-weirdness-at-openai).

The reasons behind his [short exile](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/23/sam-altmans-return-marks-a-new-phase-for-openai) remain unclear. Reports hint at various causes, from discomfort over Mr Altman’s many side projects to disagreement over whether OpenAI had struck the right balance between the safety of its products and the speed at which they were being developed.

But it is that very ability to move fast that vaulted Mr Altman into the top echelons of Silicon Valley. Mr Altman launched his first company in 2005, when he was 19, after dropping out of Stanford University. He said he worked so hard to build Loopt, a location-sharing app, that he got scurvy. Although the venture wasn’t a big success, the startup caught the eye of Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator and an influential figure in the valley. In 2014 Mr Graham put Mr Altman in charge of the tech incubator.

A year later, while still leading Y Combinator, Mr Altman founded OpenAI with a group of investors and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk. Their goal was to build artificial general intelligence (AGI), a system that can outperform humans on most intellectual tasks. But advancing AGI was time-consuming, leading Mr Altman to step back from Y Combinator in 2019. That year OpenAI—which had until then been a non-profit—set up a for-profit subsidiary to pay for expensive computing capacity and top-notch talent. The divisions this opened up led to the turmoil at OpenAI this week. Mr Altman’s return, under a new board, is likely to supercharge its business ambitions.

As an investor, Mr Altman has placed big bets on other futuristic pursuits, such as Helion Energy, a company that plans to build the world’s first nuclear-fusion power plant. His portfolio includes Retro Biosciences, a company aiming to lengthen human life, and Neuralink, a brain-implant outfit. Mr Altman evidently hopes to shake up the world in more ways than one.
