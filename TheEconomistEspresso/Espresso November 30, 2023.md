**Hamas** has agreed to release ten **Israeli** hostages on Wednesday, as part of a temporary truce agreed with Israel, as well as two **Russians** in a separate agreement made with the Kremlin. Hamas released 12 hostages on Tuesday; 30 Palestinian prisoners were in turn freed by Israel. Egyptian media reported that a tentative two-day extension to the truce, which is in its final day, had been agreed to after a meeting between America and Israel on Tuesday. Police in **Jerusalem** broke up a protest held outside Israel’s parliament by families of Israelis killed by Hamas on October 7th.

Fighting was reported in Jenin, a town in the **West Bank**, as Israeli troops continued an operation which began on Tuesday. Jenin is a stronghold of resistance for Palestinians who abhor both Israel’s occupation and the rule of the Palestinian Authority. In July Israel’s army [raided](https://web.archive.org/web/20231129165817/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/06/israel-launched-its-biggest-raid-on-the-west-bank-in-over-20-years) a refugee camp in Jenin to target the Jenin Brigades, a group of young militants.

**Sweden’s** foreign minister, Tobias Billstrom, said he had received assurances from his **Turkish counterpart** that the country would soon drop its objection to Sweden’s bid to join **NATO**. Speaking at a NATO meeting in Brussels, Mr Billstrom said that Hungary will also ratify the application. Both countries have blocked Sweden’s application for more than a year. Turkey accused Sweden of harbouring terrorists.

**Russia’s** interior minister drafted a law which would require visitors to sign a **“loyalty agreement”** promising not to criticise the country or its policies. The agreement would restrict how foreigners can talk about sensitive topics, such as gay rights and Russia’s role fighting the Nazis during the second world war. Laws in Russia, and Russian-occupied Ukraine, already [ban](https://web.archive.org/web/20231129165817/https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/08/in-moscow-all-dissent-is-muzzled) discrediting the army.

**Saudi Arabia** beat Italy to host the **World Expo** in 2030. It plans to spend $7.8bn on the event. The move is part of a multi-billion-dollar push by the crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, to diversify the country’s oil-dependent economy and [remake its international image](https://web.archive.org/web/20231129165817/https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/10/saudi-arabia-is-spending-a-fortune-on-sport). Saudi Arabia will be the second Gulf state to hold the expo in a decade, after the United Arab Emirates in 2020.

**Charlie Munger**, the vice-chairman of [Berkshire Hathaway](https://web.archive.org/web/20231129165817/https://www.economist.com/business/2021/05/06/berkshire-hathaways-questionable-performance-and-governance), an American investment conglomerate, died, aged 99. Along with Warren Buffett, the chairman, he transformed Berkshire from a struggling textile-maker into a financial empire. The firm’s investments averaged an annual gain of 20% between 1965 and 2022—around twice the return of the S&P 500 index.

The Dutch edition of a scandalous book about **Britain’s royal family** was pulled from shelves after it was found to mistakenly identify royals accused of **racism** by Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex**.** Omid Scobie, the author of “Endgame”, says he did not include those names in the English version. The error was uncovered by Rick Evers, a Dutch journalist.

### Correction: 

An earlier version of Wednesday’s World in Brief referred to Malou Airaudo as an **African choreographer**. She is in fact **French**. Sorry.

### COP28 kicks off

The doors to Expo City, an exhibition centre in Dubai, will open on Thursday for COP28, the United Nations’ annual climate summit. More than 70,000 delegates will roam the halls over two weeks. Leaders of countries and businesses will hold the spotlight in the first few days, keen to prove how much they care about global warming. Government negotiators will then try to translate those assurances into action.

The Paris agreement of 2015 stipulates that countries must produce inventories of their progress towards achieving climate goals. COP28 represents the first such “global stocktake”. Most signatories will be told that they [must try harder](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/23/progress-on-climate-change-has-not-been-fast-enough-but-it-has-been-real): a recent UN report found that no G20 countries are cutting emissions at the speed required. And this week leaked documents suggested the conference’s host, the [United Arab Emirates](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/23/how-to-thrive-in-a-fractured-world), planned to broker new oil-and-gas deals on the sidelines of the event. That does not build confidence that progress is near.

### Shoring up the oil price

At its summit on Thursday OPEC+ will consider whether to cut oil production. If, that is, the meeting goes ahead: first scheduled for Sunday, it was postponed after African producers refused to accept lower output quotas, and the issue has yet to be resolved. OPEC+ production has increased since July, largely fuelled by Iran and Nigeria. Now Saudi Arabia and Russia, which voluntarily cut their production by 1.3m barrels a day in June, are asking other members to accept reductions to guard their market share.

The cartel’s leaders want to support the oil price as global demand is forecast to slow. The war between Israel and Hamas is also on members’ minds. Iran has urged a renewal of the oil embargo OPEC imposed against America during the Arab-Israeli War in 1973. (Traders do not expect that to happen.) Any production cuts will [irk the White House](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/05/opec-defies-joe-biden-with-a-big-output-cut), which will be watching prices at the pumps as America enters an election year.

### DeSantis and Newsom debate

A [televised debate](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/26/desantis-v-newsom-the-presidential-match-up-that-isnt) on Thursday night will have all the trappings of a presidential contest: two coiffed politicians will be asked about their plans for America in a venue bedecked in red, white and blue. Yet only one participant is currently running for president. Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, will debate Gavin Newsom, his Democratic counterpart in California. Fox News, which will air the programme, is calling it: “The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate”.

The governors are wantonly grasping for the spotlight. Mr DeSantis is badly trailing Donald Trump in the polls and needs to remind Republican primary voters that he exists. Mr Newsom is not running for president—but there is always 2028.

What they say matters. Nearly a fifth of Americans live in California and Florida, and other states often copy their policies. Perhaps viewers will be treated to a mature discussion of two very different visions for America. But don’t hold your breath.

### Encouraging signs on euro-zone inflation

Inflation figures for the euro zone are released on Thursday. At last, they may offer good news. Germany’s headline annual inflation rate in November, announced on Wednesday, was 2.3%. That is just a whisker above the European Central Bank’s target of 2%. Spain’s inflation is falling faster than expected, partly because of a drop in fuel costs. Christine Lagarde, the ECB’s president, may already be drafting a “[mission accomplished](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/05/economists-draw-swords-over-how-to-fix-inflation)” speech.

The German data are explained by slower price increases across the board, as one would expect from a weak economy, and a larger year-on-year decline in energy prices than in October. At the same time, business surveys in the euro zone show a small uptick in confidence. If the ECB gets the timing of interest-rate cuts right, it may yet achieve a soft landing for euro-zone economies.

### Another record in sight for Messi

Last year Lionel Messi led Argentina to its third World Cup victory. That settled many arguments about the identity of football’s greatest-ever player. Mr Messi had already won more club trophies than his two biggest rivals, [Diego Maradona](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2020/12/03/diego-maradona-died-on-november-25th) and [Pelé](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/12/29/pele-king-of-the-beautiful-game). But he had not yet achieved similar success at the game’s largest international tournament. A big-money move this year to an American club, Inter Miami, also boosted his global public image.

Mr Messi’s status is reflected in the potential value of his memorabilia. On Wednesday Sotheby’s, a British auctioneer, will begin a sale of six of his World Cup shirts in New York. The record price for an item of football memorabilia belongs to a shirt worn by Maradona during the World Cup in 1986, which went for $9.3m last year. Months later a basketball jersey worn by Michael Jordan sold for $10.1m. Sotheby’s believes that Mr Messi’s mementoes could be in the same league.
