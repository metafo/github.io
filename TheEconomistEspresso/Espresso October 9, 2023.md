Fighting between **Israeli** forces and **Hamas** fighters and Israeli air strikes on Gaza continued into Monday, a day after militants from Gaza launched a [surprise attack](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/07/israel-reels-as-hamas-launches-a-spectacular-and-bloody-offensive) on Israel. The militants [killed](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/08/the-lessons-from-hamass-assault-on-israel) at least 700 [Israelis](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/08/its-an-anne-frank-situation-an-israeli-professor-hides-from-hamas), many of them civilians at a festival in the country’s south, and have taken dozens hostage. Officials in Gaza said that air strikes had killed more than 400 Palestinians; more than 2,000 were wounded. Hamas has urged Palestinians and other Arabs to “sweep away” the Israeli “occupation” from areas such as the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Hizbullah, an Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon, shelled Israeli military positions, suggesting that the war is widening. Israel struck back with artillery.

The **UN Security Council** gathered on Sunday for an emergency session triggered by Hamas’s [assault on Israel](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/07/israel-reels-as-hamas-launches-a-spectacular-and-bloody-offensive), but could not agree on any unanimous action. Ahead of the meeting President Joe Biden said that his administration’s support for Israel was “rock solid and unwavering”, and Britain also expressed solidarity. Russia’s ambassador to the UN argued for a ceasefire and negotiations.

With nearly all the votes counted, conservative candidates [appeared to win](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/08/state-elections-give-a-fillip-to-germanys-far-right) local elections in two large German states. The Christian Democrats (CDU) won in **Hesse**, according to ARD, a broadcaster. In **Bavaria** the Christian Social Union, the CDU’s sister party, came out on top. The results [signal dissatisfaction](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/23/a-year-after-he-promised-a-transformation-olaf-scholz-has-done-too-little) with the country’s governing centre-left coalition.

The death toll from a series of earthquakes that struck western **Afghanistan** on Saturday has risen to more than 2,000, according to Taliban officials. A further 10,000 people are reportedly injured. Hospitals are struggling to treat them. The quakes, the first two of which were of 6.3 magnitude, hit 40km from Herat, near the border with Iran. In June 2022 a 5.9-magnitude earthquake [killed](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/06/22/an-earthquake-kills-hundreds-in-afghanistan) more than 1,000 people in Khost, near Pakistan.

Around 50,000 people, according to police estimates, marched through Barcelona to protest against an **amnesty** for [Catalan separatists](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/09/09/talks-about-the-catalan-conflict-are-about-to-start). Spain’s acting prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, needs the support of a Catalan-independence party to [form a government](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/05/spains-socialists-are-struggling-to-recover-power). To secure it he could drop charges against 1,400 people who were involved in a bid for Catalan independence that led to a crisis in 2017.

**Labour** set out plans to fix **Britain’s** health service and housing shortages at its annual conference in Liverpool. [The party](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/05/is-britains-labour-party-a-bunch-of-tories-naifs-or-liars) is odds-on to [win back](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/06/labour-wins-big-in-a-scottish-by-election) power from the ruling [Conservative Party](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/05/a-glimpse-of-the-conservative-party-after-rishi-sunak) in an election expected within the next 15 months. If that happens, promised Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, Britain will have the biggest increase in affordable housing “in a generation”.

Jamie Miller, global chief financial officer of **EY**, a professional-services company, resigned after less than six months in the role after a plan to spin off its consulting business collapsed. The plan, which cost $600m, [foundered](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/04/05/ey-gets-banned-from-new-audit-business-in-germany) because of opposition from within the firm’s American audit practice. Ms Miller resigned in June but the news had not previously been reported, according to the *Financial Times*.

### Preparing for a long war in Israel

Israel and Palestine are bracing for the next stages of a war that started with a [surprise Palestinian attack](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/07/israel-reels-as-hamas-launches-a-spectacular-and-bloody-offensive) on Saturday. Militants from Hamas, an Islamist group that controls Gaza, [crossed into Israeli territory](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/08/the-lessons-from-hamass-assault-on-israel); Israel responded with air strikes. At least 600 Israelis, many of them young people who were at a music festival near the border, and 370 Palestinians, have reportedly been killed. And new fronts are opening; Hizbullah, a Lebanese Shia militia, shelled Israel, and two Israeli tourists were murdered in Egypt.

The next stage of confrontation is widely expected to be a major Israeli ground offensive. Israel is preparing large forces of infantry and armour in staging-grounds in the south. An operation to evacuate civilians from towns near the border with Gaza is expected to end on Monday morning. The government has given its leader, Binyamin Netanyahu, the authority to fight a war. He has predicted a “long and difficult” one.

### Afghanistan’s worsening humanitarian crisis

A series of earthquakes at the weekend caused devastation in western Afghanistan. Taliban officials, surveying the damage in Herat province, close to the border with Iran, put the death toll at more than 2,000. Rescue teams, working through the night, dug into the mud and timber ruins of a dozen villages wrecked by two 6.3-magnitude earthquakes as well as aftershocks.

Afghanistan is prone to quakes; [one in June 2022](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/06/22/an-earthquake-kills-hundreds-in-afghanistan) claimed more than 1,000 lives, making it the deadliest in two decades. Such disasters exacerbate the deprivation that Afghans have suffered since the [Taliban’s return to power](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/01/life-under-the-rule-of-the-taliban-20) in August 2021.

Before the latest disaster around 29m people—70% of the population—were estimated to need humanitarian aid. The UN said that Afghans needed more than $3bn in aid this year. It has raised just a quarter of that. Foreigners, traumatised by the defeat of Afghanistan’s Western-backed government, have so far held back.

### This year’s “fake” Nobel

On Monday the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences will announce the winner of this year’s [Nobel prize](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/10/05/the-2023-nobel-prizes-honour-work-that-touched-millions-of-lives) in economics. The award is often regarded as a knock-off Nobel because Alfred Nobel did not establish it. Sweden’s central bank created the award in his memory in 1968. Friedrich Hayek, in his acceptance speech in 1974, worried that the prize encouraged the perception that economic theories have the same level of evidence to back them up as theories in harder-science fields like physics.

Who could win this time? Historical data offers some clues: nearly 80% of winners have been based in America. All but two have been men. Most often they have worked at the University of [Chicago](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/07/how-chicago-school-economists-reshaped-american-justice). Unlike in other fields the academy usually gives the economics award for large bodies of work rather than for specific discoveries. The typical awardee is 67, making economics winners the oldest of any discipline.

### Macron and Scholz bond on the Elbe

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, will on Monday meet for an overnight retreat, joined by their cabinets. They will stay in a hotel in Hamburg, the port city where Mr Scholz was once mayor. Discussions are due to focus on the impact of technology on society and on artificial intelligence. But there will also be plenty of downtime, including a boat trip on the Elbe and a walk along its banks.

The relationship is in need of this sort of relaxed fraternising. [Franco-German relations](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/27/europe-has-a-problem-france-and-germany-have-forgotten-how-to-argue) have been tense since Mr Scholz came to power in 2021. The pair have disagreed about security, energy and fiscal policy. Between promenades, those pressing issues will probably resurface—the EU needs to agree on its fiscal rules, which were suspended during the covid pandemic, as well as on how to reform its electricity market. But it will take more than an away-day to [reach a compromise](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/19/france-and-germany-stifle-their-spats-to-celebrate-a-60-year-friendship) on either.

### A zoo-keeper’s collection of faeces

An unusual exhibition opens at FUSEBOX, an experimental art space in Kingston upon Thames in south-west London, on Monday. Tracey Lee, who conceived the idea, has for decades looked after elephants, rhinos, hippos and tigers at London Zoo. Twenty-two years ago, she started a routine: when her favourite animals were moved out of the zoo, she would collect their last ball of dung as a memento.

For three weeks Ms Lee’s collection of 100 samples will be on show alongside photographs, soundscapes and artworks. The exhibition brings attention to the complicated relationship between humans and animals. Some of the specimens on display come from species that humans have driven to extinction in the wild. Bringing them, and their faeces, back matters for ecosystems. Excrement can be [food for insects](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/01/09/dung-beetles-prefer-human-faeces-to-those-of-wild-animals) and help disperse seeds. It can also be food for thought.
