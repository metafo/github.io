At least 95 people were killed by two explosions in **Iran** during a ceremony to commemorate the death of Qassem Suleimani, [an Iranian general](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2020/01/09/obituary-qassem-suleimani-was-assassinated-on-january-3rd) who was assassinated by an American drone strike in 2020. The cause of the blasts, which took place in the southern city of Kerman, is currently unknown, but the city’s deputy governor described them as a terrorist attack.

**Donald Trump** asked America’s **Supreme Court** to overturn the decision by Colorado’s top court to remove him from the state’s presidential-primary ballot—and in effect [settle the question](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/02/a-clash-over-trumps-disqualification-lands-at-the-supreme-court) of his eligibility to hold office. Similar cases, arguing that Mr Trump is an insurrectionist and disqualified to be president under the 14th Amendment, are pending across the country.

The **UN** peacekeeping force in **Lebanon** said it is deeply concerned over a potential escalation of violence in the region, after a senior Hamas official was killed by a drone strike in Beirut. Lebanon’s state media said the attack was on a Hamas office in an area of Lebanon’s capital controlled by Hizbullah, an [Iranian-backed militia](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-hizbullah), and that Israel was responsible. Israel has not confirmed its involvement.

A court in **Argentina** suspended some of the reforms pushed through by **Javier Milei’s** government, dealing a blow to the new libertarian president. On December 20th Mr Milei signed a [sweeping decree](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/12/21/argentinas-javier-milei-begins-his-radical-experiment-in-libertarian-rule) of over 300 measures to deregulate sectors of Argentina’s economy. A trade union, the CGT, had requested the court review labour-law changes. The government will appeal against the ruling.

Despite a buoyant end to 2023 based on hopes that **America’s** Federal Reserve would [cut interest rates](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/29/will-america-manage-a-soft-landing-in-2024), investors’ enthusiasm cooled. After losses on Tuesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively. Minutes from the Fed’s last meeting, released on Wednesday, confirmed that rates were probably at their peak but that policy should remain restrictive “for some time”.

**Russia** and **Ukraine** exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war in a deal brokered by the [United Arab Emirates](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/23/the-messier-the-world-gets-the-more-the-uae-seems-to-thrive). Ukraine handed back 248 Russians in exchange for 230 Ukrainians. The deal comes despite recent aerial attacks by both sides. Earlier, Russian officials said that they shot down 12 Ukrainian missiles headed for Belgorod, a Russian town near the border.

Scientists reported that a new **antibiotic** showed rare promise against highly resistant *Acinetobacter baumannii* bacteria, or CRAB. The drug, developed by researchers at Harvard University and Roche, a pharma company, killed CRAB in mice and is currently being tested in humans. The World Health Organisation considers CRAB priority one pathogens, meaning they are [multi-drug resistant](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/01/22/drug-resistant-infections-kill-almost-13m-people-a-year) and pose a particular threat in hospitals.

### The risk of a regional conflict in the Middle East

In recent days fears have grown that the Israel-Hamas war could [spread across the region](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/05/the-gaza-war-has-deepened-joe-bidens-iran-nightmare). On Tuesday an air strike killed Salah al-Arouri, a senior Hamas commander, in Beirut, Lebanon’s capital. Hizbullah, an Iran-backed militia, has been firing rockets daily across Lebanon’s border with Israel, provoking Israeli counter-attacks. So far the exchange of fire has not led to all-out war. But it would not take much to start one. Explosions in Iran, which killed more than 100 people on Wednesday, are sure to heighten tensions, too. No one has claimed responsibility for the blasts.

Nor has Israel confirmed that it killed Mr al-Arouri. Israeli intelligence believes that he helped plan Hamas’s surprise attack on October 7th; he was reportedly on Israel’s hit-list. It remains unclear whether either Israel or Hizbullah really wants to let their border confrontation become something much bigger. But the warning signs are flashing.

### Trump’s ballot challenges

In December the Colorado Supreme Court ruled to disqualify Donald Trump from the state’s Republican presidential primary ballot. The justices acknowledged that the ruling put the court in “uncharted territory”. For the first time a court had applied a [section of the constitution](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/20/could-the-14th-amendment-bar-donald-trump-from-becoming-president-again) barring insurrectionists from holding office—designed after the American civil war to keep out former Confederate rebels—to a presidential candidate. Nine days later Maine’s secretary of state issued a similar decision.

Thursday had been the date by which appeals against the Colorado decision could be lodged. The Republican Party was the first to submit one to America’s Supreme Court, which means Mr Trump will stay on the ballot until it makes a move. On Wednesday Mr Trump appealed, too. The Supreme Court [will not relish](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/02/a-clash-over-trumps-disqualification-lands-at-the-supreme-court) having to weigh in on the thorny question, but with similar cases pending in many other states, it has little choice but to intervene.

### A health check for the pharmacy business

Walgreens Boots Alliance, an [American pharmacy giant](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/08/who-profits-most-from-americas-baffling-health-care-system), announces its latest results on Thursday, which cover the period from September to November 2023. The company operates over 12,000 pharmacies worldwide, including Walgreens in America and Boots in Britain. In 2022 it tried, and failed, to sell Boots, blaming choppy market conditions for the fumble. Now WBA is reportedly eyeing a public listing on the London Stock Exchange to spin off the British chain.

The company wants to focus on its more lucrative American operations. But even there cheaper generics and new entrants like [Amazon](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/20/amazon-makes-a-new-push-into-health-care) are squeezing margins on drug sales. So WBA is also expanding into health-care services. In 2021 the company spent over $5bn for a majority stake in VillageMD, a provider of basic care. The following year VillageMD acquired Summit Health-City MD, another health-care provider, for a hefty $9bn. Yet WBA remains heavily reliant on drug sales. CVS, a larger rival, has successfully diversified its business. Investors will hope WBA can do the same.

### France rides out the economic storm

France has weathered the downturn relatively well compared with its [European peers](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/12/europes-economy-is-in-a-bad-way-policymakers-need-to-react). In 2023 it is expected to have recorded modest GDP growth of 1%, beating forecasts for [Britain](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/04/britains-statisticians-fix-a-blunder-and-find-a-bigger-economy), Germany and Italy. The outlook for the French economy this year, with GDP growth forecast to be 1.2%, is also slightly better than that of its biggest neighbours. Figures released on Thursday are expected to show that the annual inflation rate was around 3.7% in December*.*

One concern is over unemployment. It inched up to 7.4% in the third quarter of 2023, having fallen from a pandemic-related high of 9% in the same period of 2020. Another is public finances. France’s budget deficit is likely to have reached 4.8% of GDP by the end of last year, partly because of hefty spending to protect consumers from soaring energy prices. The government has been phasing out that support. Still, the deficit is forecast to be 4.4% of GDP in 2024*,* above the European Union average.

### Cats and schizophrenia

Schizophrenia runs in families. But environmental factors can also affect whether someone gets the disease. According to a systematic review of existing research, published in *Schizophrenia Bulletin*, a journal, even a person’s choice of pet can affect their risk.

The paper suggests that owning a cat during childhood more than doubles a person’s chance of developing schizophrenia. The family pet, however, is not directly to blame. The real culprit is probably [*Toxoplasma gondii*](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2010/06/03/a-game-of-cat-and-mouse)*,* a parasite that cats can carry and pass on to humans through close contact*.* The protozoan can cause feelings of guilt and self-doubt in the mind of its host, and encourage risk-taking.

The mechanisms through which *Toxoplasma* affects the brain are not fully understood. The idea that it could trigger schizophrenia seems plausible, especially since antiprotozoal drugs can reverse forms of psychosis. Popular lore has long linked cat ownership to mental illness. That may be more than an ignorant stereotype.
