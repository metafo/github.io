Doctors at **Gaza’s** biggest hospital said the situation had become “catastrophic” after **Israeli** attacks on the facility reportedly intensified. The World Health Organisation said the [hospital](https://web.archive.org/web/20231111195301/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/08/all-parties-are-blaming-each-other-for-the-dire-situation-in-gaza) was facing a “bombardment” and that as many as 50,000 people were sheltering there. Israeli forces have claimed that Hamas fighters are in tunnels beneath the hospital, which Hamas denies. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, told the BBC that Israel must call a ceasefire and stop killing civilians in Gaza.

**Joe Biden** registered for the South Carolina primary, in February, now the first clash in the race to the Democratic nomination. The state has displaced Iowa and New Hampshire which used to hold the initial contests. The president should easily defeat Dean Phillips, a congressman from Minnesota and Marianne Williamson, a self-help guru. The primary matters mostly as an early test of [voter enthusiasm](https://web.archive.org/web/20231111195301/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/09/democrats-are-giddy-from-this-weeks-electoral-sweep), especially among African-Americans.

Muhammad bin Salman, the de facto leader of **Saudi Arabia**, met his **Iranian** counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, for the first time since the countries [restored diplomatic relations](https://web.archive.org/web/20231111195301/https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/03/23/iran-wants-a-detente-with-its-neighbours-but-not-with-america) in March after a seven-year lapse. The pair, among dozens of leaders from the Islamic world, were at a summit in Riyadh that was convened to discuss the situation in Gaza.

Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of **Wegovy**, [a new anti-obesity drug](https://web.archive.org/web/20231111195301/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/03/02/new-drugs-could-spell-an-end-to-the-worlds-obesity-epidemic), published a study that suggested the drug cuts patients’ risk of death by 18%. A trial of almost 18,000 people with cardiovascular diseases showed the drug lowered the risk of heart attacks by 28%. Sales of weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy, which costs more than $1300 a month in America, have been surging.

An estimated 300,000 people in London joined a march in support of **Palestinians**. The demonstration was mostly peaceful, though it had been a [source of contention](https://web.archive.org/web/20231111195301/https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/08/suella-braverman-uses-a-pro-palestinian-march-to-sow-discord) before it took place. Police in the city said that they had arrested at least 90 counter-protesters, some suspected of belonging to far-right groups, for violent behaviour.

**Iceland** declared a state of emergency over fears of a volcanic eruption, following a series of earthquakes. Thousands of tremors, the largest measuring magnitude 5.2, have been recorded in the Reykjanes Peninsula since late October. The region in southwestern Iceland had been dormant for eight centuries before an eruption in 2021.

**Taylor Swift** became the first artist to be nominated seven times for song of the year at the **Grammy** **awards**, overtaking Sir Paul McCartney and Lionel Richie. [Ms Swift](https://web.archive.org/web/20231111195301/https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/25/can-superstars-like-beyonce-or-taylor-swift-spur-inflation)—who is currently on the most lucrative concert tour in history—could also become the first musician to win the album of the year award four times. The Grammys take place in February 2024.

### Word of the week:

 ***Garimpeiros***, or “wildcat miners”. Illegal mining has surged in South America: dirty gold makes up between 70-90% of Venezuela’s output. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/11/09/illegal-gold-is-booming-in-south-america).

### Paris marches against antisemitism

It will be a tense weekend in several European cities, as the fallout from the war between [Israel and Hamas](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/07/will-america-pull-the-plug-on-israels-invasion-of-gaza) is felt on the continent’s streets. On Saturday a pro-Palestinian march took place in London, on the weekend of Britain’s annual ceremonies to remember its lost servicemen and women. These weekly protests have become increasingly politically divisive, especially since Suella Braverman, Britain’s home secretary, called them “hate marches”.

Germany, meanwhile, has tried to limit pro-Palestinian marches, and France banned them outright, citing security worries, until that decision was overturned by France's highest administrative court in October. Now a cross-party coalition of [French politicians](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/02/the-middle-east-crisis-is-splitting-the-french-opposition) will organise a march of their own, to oppose a [surge in antisemitism](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/09/antisemitism-surges-in-france-after-the-hamas-attacks-on-israel). Two former presidents, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, are due to take part in the march through Paris on Sunday. But the presence of Marine Le Pen, who says she wants to attend, has made many uneasy, and given the hard left a pretext to walk away.

### The price of Spain’s new government

After nearly four months of horse-trading, Spain is set to get a new government, led by the incumbent prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. His Socialists came a distant second in [July’s election](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/23/spains-election-ends-in-deadlock). But, with his coalition partner, he has cobbled together support from five regional nationalist parties.

Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) drove the hardest bargain. Its leader, Carles Puigdemont, fled to Belgium after organising an illegal independence referendum in Catalonia in 2017. On November 9th the Socialists and Junts [announced a deal](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/09/spains-prime-minister-offers-an-amnesty-to-catalan-separatists): Junts will support Mr Sánchez’s government in exchange for parliament passing an amnesty for the referendum’s ringleaders and organisers.

This has infuriated Spain’s right-leaning parties and even many Socialists, who say the rule of law has been trampled to serve Mr Sánchez. The Socialists call the deal a chance to turn the page on the Catalan conflict. It even might—but at the cost of much anger in the rest of Spain.

### Politics of pollution in India

On Sunday Indians will celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights. In Delhi, though, a more recent custom will accompany the holiday: a political blame game over terrible air quality. That is because in November the capital’s air begins its seasonal shift from unpleasantly foul to sickeningly filthy.

Last week city officials stopped “non-essential” construction and announced restrictions on vehicles to make the air less toxic. Much of the pollution, though, comes from crop burning and industry in neighbouring states. That means different authorities have to act in concert to lessen it. Yet the Delhi government, which is run by the Aam Aadmi Party, and the central government of Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, are [having a row](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/02/politics-hampers-delhis-fight-against-air-pollution) over who is responsible. Such partisanship will do little to clear the air.

### Tennis’s last showdown of the year

The tennis season ends with the ATP Finals in Italy on Sunday, after [another year](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/08/tennis-is-becoming-a-more-homogeneous-game) dominated by Novak Djokovic. Although Carlos Alcaraz, a young Spaniard, has established himself as the coming man, Mr Djokovic won the Australian, French and US Opens—the fourth time that he has triumphed in three of four grand slams in a year.

Mr Alcaraz, who beat Mr Djokovic at Wimbledon, is the biggest obstacle to the 36-year-old Serb winning the ATP title for a record seventh time. The eight best-performing players from the past season are split into two groups. After a round-robin stage, in which everyone plays everyone else in their group, the top two in each group play in the semi-finals. Mr Alcaraz has a tough assignment. His group includes the world number three, Daniil Medvedev, whom Mr Alcaraz beat in the Wimbledon semis, but yielded to at the same stage of the US Open.

### Jude Bellingham, an English prodigy flourishing abroad

Britain may have exported football to the world, but its players tend to be homebodies. Few leave Blighty, and those that do often struggle. After a miserable stint in Italy, Ian Rush, a prolific Welsh striker, is said to have moaned: “It was like playing in a foreign country.” There are no such complaints from Jude Bellingham, a 20-year-old midfielder, who, together with England’s captain, Harry Kane—now banging in goals for Bayern Munich—is rewriting the reputation of Brits playing abroad.

Since signing for Real Madrid in the summer, Mr Bellingham has [lit up](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/08/25/is-there-too-much-football) Spanish football. He has scored ten goals, including two to secure a famous win against Barcelona, Real’s arch-rivals. His goalscoring exploits and his now trademark celebration—standing tall, arms wide like Christ the Redeemer—have won the hearts of *los merengues*, Real’s notoriously demanding fans.

Physically imposing, Mr Bellingham is a powerhouse in midfield. But he has much more than brute force: his touch and passing are exquisite. Talent runs in the family. His father, a sergeant in the West Midlands Police, was a prolific goalscorer in non-league football; his younger brother, aged 18, is enjoying a promising season at Sunderland, a second-division team.

Above all, Mr Bellingham’s career has been characterised by clever movement—on and off the field. He came through the youth teams at second-tier Birmingham City but was so impressive in his debut season, aged 16, that Europe’s best teams came calling. He chose Borussia Dortmund in Germany, a club with a reputation for turning promising youngsters into stars. And though he played just 44 matches for Birmingham, he left an indelible impression: the Blues have since retired his jersey.

Similar plaudits followed at Dortmund, where he was voted the league’s best player in the 2022-23 season. While other prodigies struggled for game time at bigger clubs, Mr Bellingham has racked up the minutes, playing 50% more than any other teenager in the big five European leagues over the past four seasons. Real’s coach, Carlo Ancelotti, says he plays “like a veteran”.

Mr Bellingham is set for an outstanding career. The only question is how stellar. England fans are hoping he will be the man to end their country’s international-title drought, starting with the European championships in Germany next year. It might take an Englishman abroad to bring football home.
