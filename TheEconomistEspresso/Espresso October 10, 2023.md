Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Hamas** said that it would start executing Israeli captives, if Israel continues to bomb civilian houses in Gaza without warning. Earlier on Monday **Israel** ordered a “complete siege” of the **Gaza** strip, cutting off food, electricity and fuel. Officials in Gaza said that air strikes have killed more than 600 Palestinians. A further 124,000 people have been displaced from their homes, according to the UN. Israel called up 300,000 reservists, an indication that it could launch a major ground offensive in Gaza. The escalation comes two days after militants from Gaza launched a [surprise attack](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/07/israel-reels-as-hamas-launches-a-spectacular-and-bloody-offensive) on Israel, [killing](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/08/the-lessons-from-hamass-assault-on-israel) about 900 [Israelis](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/08/its-an-anne-frank-situation-an-israeli-professor-hides-from-hamas), many of them civilians at a festival in the country’s south, with dozens more taken hostage.

**The Israel Defence Forces** said that they had killed armed infiltrators entering the country from Lebanon. **Hizbullah**, an Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon, denied any involvement in the attempted breach although earlier it had shelled Israeli military positions. Meanwhile, the **EU** placed support programmes for Palestinian territories under review to ensure that no EU funding “indirectly enables any terrorist organisation” to attack Israel.

**Robert Kennedy** junior announced that he would run as an independent candidate in the American presidential election of 2024. His initial bid was for the Democratic nomination, but he lagged behind President Joe Biden in national polls. [Mr Kennedy](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/07/what-democrats-can-learn-from-bobby-kennedy)’s anti-vaccine sentiments have endeared him to far-right political figures but made him unpopular with his party and his influential family.

The **Nobel prize** in economics was awarded to Professor **Claudia Goldin**, of Harvard University. The chairman of the Nobel committee praised her achievements for “having advanced our understanding of women’s labour market outcomes”. The fact that [women’s choices](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/11/06/do-greedy-jobs-cause-the-gender-pay-gap) have often been limited by responsibility for the home is at the heart of her economic analysis.

Consuelo Porras, **Guatemala’s** attorney-general, asked the government to take action against protesters who have called for her resignation. In a video, she described the demonstrations, which have blocked roads, as “illegal”. The protesters believe she is trying to undermine [the president-elect](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/06/28/guatemalas-election-produces-a-pleasant-surprise), Bernardo Arévalo, whose Seed Movement party her office suspended for alleged voter-registration fraud. Mr Arévalo called that move a “coup”.

More members of the **United Auto Workers** union went on strike after rejecting a five-year contract deal proposed by Mack Trucks, a manufacturer. UAW members at Mack will join tens of thousands of others on picket lines, across 22 states. On September 15th UAW members began [industrial action](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/20/americas-big-car-firms-face-lengthy-strikes) against Stellantis, General Motors and Ford. (Stellantis’s biggest shareholder part-owns *The Economist*’s parent company.)

Conservative candidates [won](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/08/state-elections-give-a-fillip-to-germanys-far-right) regional elections in two big German states. The Christian Democrats (CDU) triumphed in **Hesse**, while its sister party, the Christian Social Union, took **Bavaria**. The hard-right [Alternative for Germany](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/13/support-for-the-hard-right-afd-is-surging-in-germany) party came second in both elections. Meanwhile German industrial output shrank for the fourth consecutive month by 0.2%, stoking more fears of a recession.

### Israel's two front lines

As Israel fought to secure its south, fighting spread to its north. Palestinian groups in Gaza continued to fire rockets at Israel on Monday, maintaining their [three-day assault](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/08/the-lessons-from-hamass-assault-on-israel), which has killed around 900 Israelis. At least 600 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli air strikes. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it killed “a number of” gunmen who snuck across its northern border with Lebanon. Hizballah, a Shia militant group, said several of its fighters were then killed by Israeli fire; rockets were launched at Israel from Lebanon on Monday evening.

All of this is a prelude to a bigger war. American officials expect that Israel will launch a ground invasion of Gaza in the next few days. Yoav Gallant, the defence minister, ordered the army to put Gaza under total siege: “no electricity, no food, no water, no gas” for the 2m people inside. Talks continue about a unity government in Israel; in the meantime, though, it is Binyamin Netanyahu’s hard-right coalition drawing up war plans.

### Biden’s Middle East crisis

For American policymakers, the Middle East of recent years has been relatively calm. But [Hamas’s attack](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/07/israel-reels-as-hamas-launches-a-spectacular-and-bloody-offensive) on Israel presents a crisis. As Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, pledged to avenge the atrocities, the White House made no mention of a need for restraint. America is dispatching warships and arms to support its ally.

The carnage will put on hold President Joe Biden’s effort to broker peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and his attempts to keep alive the idea of a “two-state” solution for the Palestinians. His desire to focus on Russia and China has been dashed and his hope of better relations with Iran, which supports Hamas, will be used against him by the Republicans.

For now Mr Biden will hug Israel close. But even assuming Hamas can be destroyed, who will run Gaza, and what will the status of the Palestinians be? As America and Israel both know, it is easy to be drawn into a war against terrorists. It is much harder to get out.

### Kari Lake tries again in Arizona

Though America’s 2024 elections are still more than a year away, eyes will be on Arizona on Tuesday. Kari Lake, a former news anchor who lost her bid to be the state’s governor last year, is expected to announce that she will run for the Senate. Ms Lake is one of the biggest peddlers of the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump [won](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/10/how-strong-is-trumps-defence-in-the-election-stealing-case) the 2020 presidential election.

The contest will be one of the most important Senate races of this election. Democrats control the chamber by a narrow margin, and Arizona is swingy. It is one of only five states that voted for Mr Trump in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. If Ms Lake wins the Republican primary she will probably face Ruben Gallego. Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat-turned-Independent who currently holds the seat, has not said whether she will run for re-election. After alienating Democrats by refusing to toe the party line in Congress, she needs to pull votes from both parties to win. She may yet try.

### Liberia’s close election

On Tuesday Liberians go to the polls in presidential and legislative elections. President George Weah, a famous footballer turned politician, hopes to be re-elected for a second six-year term. Among his challengers are Joseph Boakai, a former vice-president; Alexander Cummings, a businessman; and Tiawan Gongloe, a human-rights lawyer.

Polls are scarce but the race may be closer than in 2017 when Mr Weah comfortably beat Mr Boakai in a run-off. The covid pandemic hurt the West African country’s economy, and last year America placed sanctions on three officials in Mr Weah’s government for alleged corruption.

Mr Weah has also lost the support of a key backer. Prince Johnson, a senator and former warlord in Liberia’s bloody civil war that ended in 2003, has switched allegiance to Mr Boakai. That underscores one of Liberia’s enduring problems: the [belligerents](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/11/13/victims-of-liberias-civil-war-are-still-waiting-for-justice) in the civil war have never faced justice. Most candidates promise to set up a special court. Yet with Mr Johnson still influential, it is more likely the victor will drag his feet—just as Mr Weah has done.

### Bond markets digest war and high rates

Hamas’s brutal attack on Israel has shocked markets, too. In response, bond yields in Europe came off their highs, and stock prices fell slightly. On Tuesday, American markets will re-open after a long weekend, digesting both the Israeli conflict and a [surge](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/04/a-surge-in-global-bond-yields-threatens-trouble) in long-term bond yields that preceded it.

That surge had many sources. Rising prices was not one of them; markets’ expectation of inflation stayed roughly flat. The brighter growth outlook for America’s economy, which added 336,000 jobs in September, certainly helped, as did high public deficits pushing up the real rate of interest. But now a higher “term premium”—the added compensation that investors demand for the risk of tying themselves to a longer-dated security—comes on top. The exact reason for why the term premium increased is still speculative, but the war in Israel will add to the uncertainty that tends to push it higher. Bond yields may slip when the markets re-open, but the higher term premium might limit the fall of long-term rates.
