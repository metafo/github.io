America will reportedly build a pier off Gaza’s coast to allow additional aid into the enclave. President Joe Biden is expected to announce the project in his state-of-the-union address. Officials said that the project would take “weeks”. Earlier Negotiators representing **Hamas** failed to broker a ceasefire agreement during talks in Cairo. Egyptian and Qatari mediators had hoped to broker a 40-day truce in **Gaza** ahead of Ramadan, which begins next week. Hamas said that its representatives will continue to negotiate with **Israel** indirectly.

The **European Union** extended tariff-free access to its markets for **Ukrainian** food producers. The bloc waived import duties and quotas for the country’s farmers in 2022 after the war disrupted shipments across the [Black Sea](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/05/18/how-to-unblock-ukraines-ports-to-relieve-world-hunger). The latest arrangement introduces a concession to [angry farmers](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/01/europes-grumpy-farmers-are-a-symptom-of-wider-malaise) whose protests have rocked the continent: tariffs could be re-introduced if Ukrainian imports climb above recent averages.

**Sweden** formally became a member of **NATO**, nearly two years after it applied to join the alliance. Ulf Kristersson, Sweden’s prime minister, exchanged the final documents required for [accession](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/01/sweden-clears-a-turkish-hurdle-to-nato-accession) at a meeting with American officials in Washington. Sweden’s armed forces will add [domestically-made Gripen jets](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/04/23/ukraines-top-guns-need-new-jets-to-win-the-war) to NATO’s arsenal, along with a new generation of submarines by 2028.

Dozens of schoolchildren, some reportedly as young as eight, were **abducted** in north-western **Nigeria** on Thursday morning by [bandits on motorbikes](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/18/killings-and-abductions-persist-in-nigeria), several outlets reported. According to the BBC, witnesses say more than 100 children were taken. The abduction comes less than a week after scores of people, mostly girls, were kidnapped by suspected Islamist militants affiliated with [Boko Haram](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/05/01/what-is-boko-haram) in the country’s north-east.

The juntas in **Niger**, **Mali** and **Burkina Faso** agreed to form a joint force to fight jihadist militias. The military regimes of the west African countries have recently cut ties with France and built relations with Russia, which has strengthened its presence in the region. Islamist groups [killed thousands](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/its-going-to-get-grimmer-in-the-sahel) in west Africa last year.

**Norway’s** government advised companies to avoid conducting business with entities that support **Israeli settlements** in the [West Bank](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/06/settlers-are-causing-mayhem-in-the-west-bank). Espen Barth Eide, Norway’s foreign minister, said that firms could risk contributing to violations of international law and human rights in the territory. A statement from the foreign ministry expressed concern over growing [settler violence](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/08/a-history-of-settler-violence-in-the-west-bank).

A British right-wing activist won a **legal battle** to establish an “Academy for the Judeo-Christian West” in Italy. Benjamin Harnwell [tried to set up a “gladiator academy”](https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/05/23/steve-bannons-monastic-academy-denies-monkey-business) for right-wing politicians in a former monastery near Rome. But the project became mired in litigation as Italian prosecutors alleged that he had failed to pay €200,000 ($220,000) in rent. Now the venture “lives to fight another day”.

### A cooler job market in America

After a blockbuster start to 2024, the American labour market appears to have slowed. Figures on Friday are expected to show that it added 200,000 jobs in February, well below a big 350,000 jump in January. This kind of slowdown is exactly what the Federal Reserve and investors [want to see](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/09/does-america-need-more-unemployment). The surge in January fuelled concerns that growth and inflation were accelerating again, which could have forced the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer.

Instead, a moderate softening may clear the way for the central bank to start cutting rates in the coming months. There are some faint signs: workers who lose their jobs are taking longer to find new ones, and wage growth is tailing off. But at the same time the economy is running well clear of a recession: the unemployment rate is forecast to have remained steady at 3.7%, near a five-decade low.

### Orban meets Trump

On Friday Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, will meet Donald Trump at his estate in Florida, Mar-a-Lago. He is not planning to stop in Washington to meet the president, Joe Biden. Mr Orban believes that he and Mr Trump are at the vanguard of an [international alliance](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/02/15/national-conservatives-are-forging-a-global-front-against-liberalism) against globalism. Both of them espouse a virulent new style of conservatism based on nationalism, opposition to international migration and the view that woke ideas are taking over Western culture.

Mr Orban is isolated within the European Union and NATO because he tramples the rule of law in Hungary and staunchly opposes military aid to Ukraine. A Republican victory in America’s presidential election would improve his standing. He is one of only a few international leaders who would welcome a win by Mr Trump in November. Many dread the prospect.

### A welcome drop in food prices

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 sent global prices of foodstuffs soaring. Food insecurity subsequently rose in poor countries. Prices have come down since 2023, mostly owing to bumper Russian wheat exports and a global expansion in agricultural production in response to high prices. In addition, overall inflation depressed demand for some commodities, especially sunflower oil.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s food-price index, which tracks international prices, fell in January by 10.4% compared with a year earlier. The index was at its lowest level since early 2021. The February figures, released on Friday, will probably show another decline.

But it is not all [sweet news](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/02/28/why-chocolate-is-becoming-much-more-expensive). The FAO’s sugar-price index was 16% higher in January than a year earlier. Another increase is likely in February. El Niño, a climate pattern, has caused droughts in Australia, India and Thailand—three of the four biggest exporters of sugar. That will be bitter for folk with a sweet tooth.

### Ireland’s liberalising referendum proposals

On Friday the Irish public will vote in two referendums on proposals to modernise the constitution. Voters will decide whether to scrap language referring to women’s “life within the home” and to offer constitutional recognition to families not founded on marriage.

The referendums take place on International Women’s Day. The proposals have the support of almost all parliamentary parties. The constitution was written in 1937, when the influence of the Catholic church was much stronger. But the country has recently become more liberal: it voted decisively in favour of legalising same-sex marriage in 2015 and [abortion in 2018](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/05/26/irish-referendum-voters-decisively-opt-for-permitting-abortion).

Some government politicians worry that the proposals will be defeated. The Yes campaign has been lacklustre, and turnout is expected to be low. Among the people who may be motivated to show up are voters angry about a cost-of-living crisis and a housing shortage: they may use the polls to rebuke the establishment. A growing anti-immigrant movement could do the same. Leo Varadkar, the prime minister, said that defeat would be a “setback for Ireland”.

### Ariana Grande returns

Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Or so hopes Ariana Grande. The pop star released six albums in the seven years to 2020. Her fans have had to wait another four for her seventh album, “Eternal Sunshine”, released on Friday. Ms Grande recorded it during the recent Hollywood strikes, which paused the filming of “Wicked”, a pair of musical films in which she stars.

There has been no spate of singles, nor have previews been made available to critics. Ms Grande wants her fans to “experience” the album for the first time in its entirety. She has released only one song, with the characteristically insouciant title of “Yes, And?”. The house-music bop soared right to the top of the [Billboard Hot 100 chart](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/02/03/max-martin-knows-how-to-create-a-number-one-hit). Sources at her record company, Republic Records, have promised more of the same on the album.
