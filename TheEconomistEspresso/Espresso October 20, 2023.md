## The world in brief

### October 20, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Around 20 lorries carrying **aid** waited to enter the [Gaza Strip](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/israels-four-unpalatable-options-for-gazas-long-term-future) after **Egypt** agreed to open its border crossing for delivery of humanitarian supplies. The White House suggested the aid would be delivered by Friday. The World Health Organisation described the move as a “very, very small start” and suggested at least 100 trucks a day were needed. Meanwhile the American embassy in Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, told American citizens to leave the country. Other Western countries such as France and Canada have warned against travel to [Lebanon](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/18/the-arab-world-thinks-differently-about-this-war) as concerns grow that a [second front](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/13/israel-faces-the-danger-of-fighting-on-a-second-front) could emerge on the Lebanese-Israeli border.

An American **warship** in the Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones that the Pentagon said were launched from **Yemen**, “potentially” targeting Israel. Militants backed by **Iran** have previously launched rockets and drones from Yemen. Tensions in the region are high; earlier this week Iran threatened “preemptive” action to defend Gaza. The warship, the USS Carney, reported no casualties.

America’s **House of Representatives** remained paralysed as Jim Jordan, the Republican nominee for the speakership, said he would seek a third vote. The announcement was a reversal from his position hours before, when he said he would pause his bid. Some Republicans instead favour temporarily granting Patrick McHenry, the interim speaker, expanded powers.

**Canada** brought home 41 diplomats from **India** as a result of a growing dispute over the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia last June. In September Canada [accused Indian agents](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/19/a-devastating-accusation-by-justin-trudeau-against-india) of orchestrating the killing, an allegation which India denies. According to Canada’s foreign minister, India said it would remove immunity from “all but 21 diplomats” by October 20th.

The EU awarded the **Sakharov prize**, a human-rights award, to **Mahsa Amini**, a Kurdish-Iranian woman who died in police custody last year, and the women’s rights movement she inspired. Amini’s death, after being arrested by Iran’s [morality police](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/26/who-are-irans-hated-morality-police) for apparently transgressing its dress code, sparked huge [anti-government protests](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/12/protests-have-subsided-in-iran-but-clerics-cannot-yet-proclaim-victory). This year an Iranian activist, [Narges Mohammadi](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/06/a-woman-described-as-irans-nelson-mandela-wins-the-nobel-peace-prize), won the Nobel peace prize.

**Russia** arrested an American journalist for failing to register as a foreign agent. Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American citizen who works for Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, an [American-funded media outlet](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/06/25/decapitating-americas-state-funded-media), was detained in Kazan, a city in central Russia. In March [Evan Gershkovich](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/03/30/the-kremlin-escalates-its-war-on-truth), an American reporter for the *Wall Street Journal,* was arrested on espionage charges.

**Sex workers** in **Amsterdam**, the Netherlands’ capital, protested against plans to move their famous red light district to a multi-story “erotic centre” on the city’s outskirts. The mayor sees the move as a way to reduce nuisance and crime in Amsterdam’s city centre. The protesters, many of whom wore masks, said they should not be punished for poor crowd control.

**Correction:** A previous edition of The World in Brief implied that Donald Tusk is a former president of Poland. He was, in fact, prime minister. Sorry.

### Biden hosts von der Leyen

President Joe Biden will receive Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, at the White House on Friday. The long-planned summit was supposed to focus on trade. America wants Europe to join a metals “club” that would impose tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium; in return America would drop tariffs that penalise European producers. But even a deal on that will be overshadowed by developments in Israel, where both leaders have travelled since the outbreak of war with Hamas.

The EU has struggled to formulate a [coherent response](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/the-eus-response-to-the-crisis-in-israel-exposes-its-limits) to the conflict. Germany has emphasised Israel’s right to self-defence, while Ireland and Spain fret about the harm to ordinary Palestinians. Mrs von der Leyen will be accompanied to Washington by Charles Michel, the president of the European Council (who chairs meetings of EU leaders). Expect Mr Michel to remind her to stick to trade matters—and let him handle the geopolitics.

### Tank lessons for Israel from Ukraine

For the first time since the invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Israel’s entire armoured corps has been called up. That includes around 1,000 [main battle tanks](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/16/israels-tank-commanders-are-studying-russias-mistakes), a proportion of which will spearhead the attack on Hamas. Lumbering tanks in the narrow streets of the Gaza Strip might seem to be a liability. But nothing can replace the tank’s firepower. And the Israelis have learned plenty from Russia’s stalled invasion of Ukraine on how to deploy them properly.

Russia’s armoured regiments operated as separate units, often sent single-file down a road, allowing them to be picked off by the Ukrainians. Israel’s tanks will fight in “combined-arms” fashion, with infantry, combat-engineering and artillery units co-ordinated with intelligence and air power. Israel’s Merkava tanks have also been seen with Russian-style [cages](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/russian-tanks-in-ukraine-are-sprouting-cages/21808191) fixed over the turret to block attacks from above (eg, from drones). The Israelis are out to prove that the tank is far from obsolete.

### Japan’s government faces tests

[Kishida Fumio](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/04/13/japans-prime-minister-has-recovered-from-a-rough-patch), who became Japan’s prime minister two years ago, has never been [popular](https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/09/29/kishida-fumio-will-become-japans-new-prime-minister/21805100). With [inflation](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/18/prices-are-rising-in-japan-but-not-wages) over 3% and amid financial scandals in his Liberal Democratic Party, his cabinet’s approval rating has dipped to a record low of 32%, according to Kyodo, a Japanese newswire.

During an extraordinary parliamentary session, which starts on Friday and will last until December, Mr Kishida will try to bolster public support with an economic stimulus package including tax cuts and wage hikes. Once the package is approved he may then call an early general election—over which speculation has long swirled.

The Kishida administration also faces another test. On Sunday parliamentary by-elections will be held in the southern regions of Nagasaki and Kochi. Both are two-way contests between the ruling party and single opponents. Given the opposition’s own weaknesses, and despite Mr Kishida’s unpopularity, they may be tight. Wins on Sunday could give him the space he needs to cling on.

### Brits tighten their belts, again

The British economy is in a strange place. Recent [revisions](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/04/britains-statisticians-fix-a-blunder-and-find-a-bigger-economy) to historic GDP suggested its post-pandemic performance was not as disastrous as once believed. But not disastrous is not the same as good.

The annual inflation rate, at 6.3%, remains uncomfortably high. The Bank of England has carried out rapid monetary tightening to bring it down. Those 14 rate rises are beginning to bite, with job vacancies falling and wage growth slowing. Consumers are feeling the pressure, as September’s retail-sales data, due on Friday, are expected to show.

The worst of the squeeze on household incomes may be over. But as consumers seek to pay down debt accumulated during the cost-of-living crisis, spending growth is likely to be weak in the months ahead. Meanwhile business-to-business sales, which have helped prop up growth this year, may also flag. Whether Britain enters a recession remains uncertain. But for many Britons it will feel that way.

### Stones on a roll

The Rolling Stones’s last collection of original material, “A Bigger Bang”, came out 18 years ago. After the death of their drummer, [Charlie Watts](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/08/25/charlie-wattss-drumming-style-helped-define-the-rolling-stones-sound), in 2021, a follow-up seemed unlikely. But the three surviving Stones, Mick Jagger (80), Keith Richards (79) and Ronnie Wood (76), have at last recorded a new album, released on Friday.

They have not mellowed with age. On “Hackney Diamonds” (slang for fragments of a shattered windscreen), the band hurtle through 11 punk, disco, country, gospel and glam-rock anthems written by the Glimmer Twins, plus “Rolling Stone Blues”, a cover of the Muddy Waters song that gave the band its name six decades ago.

Nothing on the album matches “Jumpin’ Jack Flash”, released in 1968. But all of the Diamonds are highly polished gems. And because Sir Mick claims that the group has already completed “almost three-quarters” of their next album, it could be released before another 18 years roll by.
