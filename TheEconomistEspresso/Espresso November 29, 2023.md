The heads of **Israel’s** and **America’s** intelligence agencies met in Qatar to discuss a possible next phase of a [truce](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/26/a-brutal-battle-for-southern-gaza-beckons-after-the-truce-ends) between Israel and Hamas, which is in its fifth day. The meeting between the CIA and Mossad was also attended by Egyptian officials, according to Reuters. The temporary truce was extended on Monday to facilitate the exchange of more hostages being held in Gaza with [Palestinian prisoners](https://www.economist.com/interactive/the-economist-explains/2023/11/27/who-are-the-palestinians-in-israels-prisons) held in Israel. According to the Israel Defence Forces, Hamas released a group of 12 hostages to the Red Cross on Tuesday; 30 Palestinian prisoners were in turn released by Israel.

**Finland** will close its only remaining border crossing with **Russia** to reduce the number of asylum-seekers entering the country. Some 900 people, many from Somalia and Syria, arrived in November, compared with only a few dozen in September and October. The border will close for two weeks. Finland says Russia is funnelling migrants across the border in retaliation for its joining [NATO](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/03/22/finland-has-turkeys-approval-and-can-at-last-join-nato).

**Argentina**’s president-elect, [Javier Milei](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/11/23/javier-milei-will-be-argentinas-first-libertarian-president), met with America’s national security adviser, [Jake Sullivan](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/16/why-america-struggles-to-make-friends-abroad), on Tuesday as part of a trip to Washington, DC. His team also met with officials from the IMF, which Argentina owes more than $40bn. Mr Milei, a self-described “anarcho-capitalist”, won 56% of Argentine votes in a presidential election run-off in mid-November. He will be inaugurated on December 10th.

Britain’s antitrust regulator challenged a deal which would see **Adobe**, an American [tech giant](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/10/16/how-adobe-became-silicon-valleys-quiet-reinventor), buy **Figma**, a smaller rival, for $20bn. The Competition and Markets Authority said that the deal, announced last year, would harm competition in the design-software sector. The watchdog will decide by the end of February whether to block the merger. Earlier this month the European Commission raised similar concerns.

**North Korean** state media announced results from the country’s local elections on Sunday, reporting dissenting votes for the first time in decades. In the totalitarian dictatorship, voters either approve or disapprove a single, party-backed candidate. Over 99% of voters allegedly opted to approve the candidates. Elected bodies, in any event, hold virtually no power.

**American shoppers** spent $38bn online in the five days after **Thanksgiving**—known as “cyber week”—according to Adobe Analytics. Large discounts encouraged shoppers to spend more than analysts had expected, given the pressure of inflation on household budgets. Shoppers spent $12.4bn on “cyber Monday”, America’s busiest online shopping day, compared with $11.3bn last year.

**Rescuers** in Uttarakhand, a state in northern **India**, freed 41 construction workers, who became trapped inside a collapsed **tunnel** more than two weeks ago. Miners dug through 60 metres of rubble by hand to reach the men, who were digging the road tunnel when the roof fell in. The trapped men were brought out on stretchers through a narrow pipe.

### A health check for the world economy

In the past couple of months, as the world watched hellish scenes in Gaza, the [global economic outlook](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/the-world-economy-is-defying-gravity-that-cannot-last) has incongruously improved. Mayhem in the Middle East has not prevented the oil price from dropping. America’s annual inflation rate has continued to fall. And China’s government has shown that it is willing to do more to revive growth in the world’s second-biggest economy, even raising its fiscal deficit above the 3%-of-GDP limit it likes to impose on itself.

The OECD, a club of 38 mostly rich countries, will take stock of these developments in its report on the [global economy](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/02/markets-think-interest-rates-could-stay-high-for-a-decade-or-more), released on Wednesday. The report, last updated in September, may also reassess the economic fortunes of Mexico, where remittances have been strong, and Russia, where fiscal policy has been loose. The biggest change, however, will probably be its forecasts for Israel, which joined the club in 2010. Its economy cannot defy the geopolitical gloom.

### Growing unrest in Bangladesh

The Bangladesh National Party, the country’s main opposition, will blockade railways, roads and waterways across the country on Wednesday. It is protesting against repression by the ruling party, the Awami League, ahead of a general election due to take place in January. Tensions have been escalating since October, when the government suppressed opposition rallies that called for the installation of a neutral caretaker government ahead of the elections—once a legal requirement.

The [Bangladeshi government](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/01/bangladeshs-economic-miracle-is-in-jeopardy) is intensifying its crackdowns on the opposition. The BNP has said that more than 16,000 members were arrested after the rallies in October. In response to that repression, the EU criticised Bangladesh’s government and America imposed visa sanctions on complicit government officials. The BNP’s protests have reduced traffic on roads and waterways, and demonstrators have burned hundreds of vehicles during successive blockades. So far, they have not swayed the government.

### France’s justice minister on trial

During the past month, unprecedentedly, a French cabinet minister has remained in office while facing charges in court. Eric Dupond-Moretti, the justice minister, is accused of using his office to settle old scores with magistrates and prosecutors. Mr Dupond-Moretti, a former criminal lawyer, denies the charges and called the trial “an infamy”. On Wednesday a special tribunal will reach a verdict. If found guilty, the minister faces up to five years in prison and a €500,000 ($550,000) fine.

The trial has highlighted the loyalty of Emmanuel Macron, the president, to [colleagues](https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/07/09/an-unknown-prime-minister-reinforces-macrons-centralised-presidency) who run into legal problems. (Mr Macron’s labour minister, Olivier Dussopt, went on trial for corruption earlier this week; like Mr Dupond-Moretti, he has denied wrongdoing and remains in post.) But it also raises questions about the practicalities of trying ministers. The tribunal convened to consider if Mr Dupond-Moretti politicised justice is largely composed of MPs.

### Revamping Europe’s electricity grid

The EU has one of the world’s most extensive [electricity networks](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/28/can-europes-power-grid-cope-with-the-green-transition). But its [slow redevelopment](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/27/europes-gas-and-electrical-grids-need-expanding) is hindering the bloc’s ambitious green transition. To rectify that the European Commission is expected to unveil an “Action Plan for Grids” on Wednesday.

Electricity grids will have to [grow and change shape](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2023/04/05/the-electric-grid-is-about-to-be-transformed) to deliver renewable forms of energy, which the EU hopes will make up 42.5% of its power mix by 2030. Increasing capacity is also needed to decarbonise industry and other emitters of greenhouse gas. But Europe’s infrastructure is nationalised and outdated. Delays in issuing permits, underinvestment and skills shortages all impede expansion. The commission’s plan should offer a roadmap for integrating renewable power, which is less centralised than the conventional sort, into the grid. That would help expand it and promote the EU’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

### A daring ballet in New York

“The Rite of Spring”, a ballet by Igor Stravinsky, a Russian composer, has always shocked. At its first performance in Paris in 1913 the audience rioted in response to the ballet’s bold music and Vaslav Nijinsky’s choreography. In 1975 Pina Bausch, a German choreographer, surprised again with her version of the ballet, which tells the story of a virginal girl selected for sacrifice at the start of spring. Bausch’s reinterpretation will be performed at the Park Avenue Armory in New York from Wednesday.

Bausch covered her stage with brown loam, which stuck to the dancers as the ballet progressed. That symbolised winter’s thaw and the moral darkness of ritual murder. The production in New York features 36 dancers from 14 African countries, translating this European tale to a different context. The work is also paired with dances inspired by Germaine Acogny and Malou Airaudo, African choreographers. The newest version shows that Stravinsky’s “Rite” springs eternal.
