Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Gaza’s health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said that hundreds of people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a hospital in Gaza City where Palestinians were receiving treatment or sheltering. The Israel Defence Forces denied Israeli responsibility and blamed a failed rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, declared three days of mourning.

Jordan’s foreign minister said that it would cancel the four-party summit that Joe Biden was due to attend on Wednesday in Amman, the capital. The announcement came as Mr Biden left Washington, DC for Israel. Hours earlier Mr Abbas had backed out of the meeting following a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza.

Jim Jordan lost a vote on the floor of America’s House of Representatives to become the chamber’s speaker. Twenty Republicans and all 212 Democrats withheld their support, leaving the hardline Republican congressman with 200 votes. He needed 217 to clinch the position, which has been vacant since October 3rd when Republican Kevin McCarthy was ousted.

Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, met with Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, at a summit in Beijing marking the tenth anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative. It is Mr Putin’s second trip abroad since the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest over alleged war crimes in Ukraine. Mr Putin also held talks with the leaders of Hungary and Vietnam, and is expected to meet the leaders of Mongolia and Thailand.

Ukraine made successful strikes on Russian airfields near the occupied cities of Luhansk and Berdyansk, according to officials in Kyiv. A local Russian-installed official suggested the attack had failed, but a Russian military analyst suggested it could be the worst blow against the country’s air force since the war began. Russia’s government has yet to comment.

Poland’s opposition parties won enough seats in Sunday’s election to form a coalition that could unseat the national-populist Law and Justice (PiS) government. A final vote count gave PiS 35.4% of the vote, the largest share, and 194 of 460 seats in parliament—but between them its liberal rivals won 248 seats. PiS can delay the opposition from forming a government for almost two months in a last-ditch attempt to cling to power.

The Scottish government announced plans to sell bonds for the first time, using powers devolved from Westminster in 2016. Speaking at the ruling Scottish National Party’s annual conference, Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, said that his government would raise funds in the capital markets by the end of its term in 2026. The SNP, which has suffered a series of scandals in recent months, has seen its popularity fall.

### Biden in Israel

On Wednesday Joe Biden will arrive in Israel. The visit to the Middle East was hastily arranged then promptly blown up by an explosion at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians. Amid mutual recriminations over who was responsible, Jordan cancelled a summit it was due to host with Mr Biden as well as Palestinian and Egyptian leaders.

The Israeli armed forces said the explosion at the hospital had been caused by a malfunctioning rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group. Most of the Arab world was convinced it was an Israeli strike.

The president pressed on with the trip nevertheless, visiting Israel only. But the worsening plight of Palestinians in Gaza, and the danger of growing escalation, grimly illustrates the difficulty of the path he is trying to steer: show his love for Israel while protecting civilians in the Gaza Strip; support Israel’s retribution while restraining its excesses; and deter Iran and its proxies while coaxing Arab allies to help.

### China’s colossal GDP downgrade

It has been a costly few months for [China’s economy](https://web.archive.org/web/20231018231255/https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/24/chinas-economy-is-in-desperate-need-of-rescue). In April the IMF forecast that China’s GDP would add up to a cumulative $104trn (in today’s dollars) over the five years from 2023 to 2027. Six months later, the fund has cut almost $12trn from that forecast. This colossal downgrade reflects the run of bad data China has suffered since the spring, as its [property market](https://web.archive.org/web/20231018231255/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/10/12/amid-turmoil-in-chinas-property-market-the-public-seethes) slumped, exports shrank, [currency weakened](https://web.archive.org/web/20231018231255/https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/21/does-chinas-fear-of-floating-exceed-its-fear-of-deflation) and [deflation](https://web.archive.org/web/20231018231255/https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/10/deflation-and-default-haunt-chinas-economy) beckoned.

Thanks to falling prices, the IMF expects China’s nominal growth (which includes inflation) to be weaker than its real growth this year. That unusual pattern was also visible in official figures released on Wednesday. They showed that China's GDP grew by 4.9% in the third quarter, compared with a year earlier, faster than expected. But its nominal growth was only 3.5%, suggesting prices fell by almost 1.4%. Growth may be bottoming out, but deflation remains a danger.

### Lavrov in North Korea

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, arrives in North Korea on Wednesday. The two-day visit will make politicians in the West nervous. On Friday America accused North Korea of shipping 1,000 containers full of weapons to Russia. It is not the first time America has accused Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s leader, of such a thing. But it is alarmed that the two countries are growing closer.

Mr Lavrov’s trip comes a month after Mr Kim journeyed to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin. Russia needs [more weapons](https://web.archive.org/web/20231018231255/https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/13/why-is-vladimir-putin-looking-to-north-korea-for-arms) for its war in Ukraine; North Korea is thought to have large stockpiles of compatible munitions. In return Mr Putin indicated a willingness to help Mr Kim put a satellite into orbit, potentially in violation of UN sanctions, and offered technology that could improve its delivery of nuclear weapons. Closer ties will not just affect Ukraine; it could also make Asia a scarier place.

### Tesla’s growth stalls

For years Elon Musk’s Tesla was the only name in the [electric-vehicle game](https://web.archive.org/web/20231018231255/https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/18/teslas-surprising-new-route-to-ev-domination). No longer. General Motors, Volkswagen and other traditional carmakers are now investing heavily in electric. Newer Chinese rivals like BYD and NIO have also sped into markets. On Wednesday Tesla will report results for its most recent quarter. Analysts expect sales to have grown by 14% year-on-year, down from 56% a year earlier. As its market share has tumbled, the company has slashed prices, causing profits to shrink.

Optimists hope a long-promised “affordable” Tesla, priced at $25,000, will bring growth by tapping into the mass market. In the meantime, the company is rethinking its aversion to advertising. Tesla long relied on Mr Musk’s [cult-like following](https://web.archive.org/web/20231018231255/https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/04/21/the-musk-superfans-who-want-to-live-on-mars-with-elon) to drum up business. But his increasingly [eccentric behaviour](https://web.archive.org/web/20231018231255/https://www.economist.com/films/2023/08/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-elon-musk) means that strategy may be faltering. Some Tesla drivers now sport a bumper sticker that reads “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy.”

### Futuristic advances in bionics

“The Creator”, a recent science-fiction film, portrays a future in which man and machine have seamlessly merged. Robots resemble humans, and the protagonist begins each day by affixing a bionic hand. That part, however, is already more science than fiction.

As reported in *Science Robotics*, a journal, a Swedish woman has lived for more than three years with a removable bionic hand, fused to her sensorimotor system. The woman, who lost her right arm in a farming accident, underwent surgeries to join her severed nerves to muscle grafts and implant electrodes to execute commands. The electrodes receive electrical signals that travel from the brain down the nerves. They are then wired to the bionic hand through titanium rods implanted in her bones, which protrude outside her stump.

The result is a robotic hand with which the woman can manipulate small objects and feel how solid they are. Bionics is approaching the “holy grail”: a prosthetic limb with control as instant and intuitive as flesh.
