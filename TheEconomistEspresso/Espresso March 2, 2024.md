The US air force dropped almost 40,000 meals in Gaza, where the UN estimates that over 500,000 people are on the brink of famine. On Thursday violence erupted when thousands of hungry civilians [surrounded an aid convoy](https://web.archive.org/web/20240302232204/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/29/a-new-tragedy-shows-anarchy-rules-in-gaza). Gaza’s health ministry said more than 112 people died. Local authorities say Israeli soldiers shot them dead. Israel says they fired warning shots and most died in a stampede. The UN later said that many people treated at a nearby hospital had gunshot wounds.

General Oleksandr Syrsky, the commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, suggested that he would consider replacing some commanders on the eastern front, where fighting with Russia [appears to have intensified](https://web.archive.org/web/20240302232204/https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/ukraine-fires). General Syrsky made the comments in a post on Telegram, a messaging app. On February 17th Ukrainian forces withdrew from the town of Avdiivka, the first movement on the front in months. Two nearby villages fell to Russia this week.

A cargo ship carrying 37,000 tonnes of fertiliser sank in the Red Sea after it was attacked by Houthi rebels in Yemen last month. Yemen’s government, which reported the sinking, called it an “environmental catastrophe”. [The Houthis’](https://web.archive.org/web/20240302232204/https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/12/who-are-the-houthis-the-group-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea) strikes on ships are in retaliation for Israel’s war in Gaza. American and British air strikes have failed to deter the rebels.

The proportion of Americans who think Joe Biden is doing a poor job rose to 47%, the highest of his presidency, according to a new poll. The survey by Siena College and the *New York Times* also found that [Democrats](https://web.archive.org/web/20240302232204/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/29/does-joe-bidens-re-election-campaign-have-a-gaza-problem) are split over whether Mr Biden should be the party’s nominee for the election in November. According to [our poll tracker](https://web.archive.org/web/20240302232204/https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/trump-biden-polls) the race between Mr Biden and Donald Trump is too close to call.

Fitch, one of the big three credit-rating agencies, downgraded New York Community Bancorp to a junk rating after the [regional bank](https://web.archive.org/web/20240302232204/https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/08/are-nycbs-troubles-the-start-of-another-banking-panic) said it discovered “material weaknesses” in the way it reviewed loan risks and replaced its chief executive. Shares in NYCB fell by 26% on Friday, and have gone down by 65% so far this year.

Walgreens and CVS, two major pharmacy chains, announced they would start selling mifepristone, an [abortion drug](https://web.archive.org/web/20240302232204/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/02/26/the-big-american-post-roe-battle-over-abortion-pills), in some states this month, including New York and Pennsylvania. It marks the first time the medication will be accessible at retail pharmacies in America. The Supreme Court will hear a case this month that could prevent patients from receiving mifepristone by post or obtaining a prescription remotely.

California shut down a 160km stretch of Interstate-80, a motorway, after a blizzard made the road too dangerous to use. The storm hit the region on Thursday and is expected to continue to cause havoc through Saturday. As much as 3m of snow is predicted in the area around Lake Tahoe, which straddles the California-Nevada border. Some 24,000 houses and businesses are without power.

### New Jersey’s surprising Senate race

High drama is playing out in community centres and union halls across New Jersey. Democratic county committees are deciding whom to back in an upcoming Senate race. Andy Kim, a congressman, is considered the underdog. His rival is Tammy Murphy, the governor’s wife.

They are vying for the Senate seat held by Bob Menendez, who is facing a [corruption indictment](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/28/bob-menendezs-indictment-is-colourful-even-by-jersey-standards) (it is his second, and he denies all wrongdoing). Many believed the race was a foregone conclusion. Ms Murphy was endorsed by virtually all of New Jersey’s influential Democrats.

But she is not having things all her own way. Her opponent is on a roll, having won three of four counties so far. On Sunday Mr Kim will probably win the support of Democratic committee members in Warren County. That momentum has made Bergen, New Jersey’s most populous county, which votes on Monday, competitive ground.

### El Salvador elects local officials

In February Nayib Bukele’s New Ideas party won El Salvador’s presidential and legislative elections in a landslide. On Sunday the country’s president is likely to consolidate his party’s dominance when voters pick mayors and local councils. Polls suggest that only 40% of Salvadoreans intend to vote for New Ideas, compared with 70% in the legislative elections. But last year Mr Bukele cut the number of mayors from 262 to just 42. That rearranged voting boundaries, giving New Ideas a better chance.

Mr Bukele is popular because he has cracked down on gangs. The murder rate has tumbled. But the cost is high: the president allows no dissent. Since coming to office in 2019, he has dismantled or co-opted institutions that limited presidential power. His second consecutive term, which officially starts in June, is widely [considered unconstitutional](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/02/05/after-nayib-bukeles-crushing-unconstitutional-victory-what-next). But in 2021 he got the top court to rule that he could run again. He and his party are here to stay.

### The controversial designs of Tropical Modernism

Modernist architecture focuses on the [functionality](https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/09/11/how-a-modernist-architect-won-over-traditionalists) of a building. The minimalist movement was developed in continental Europe in the 1920s. When it reached Britain a decade later, it was largely rejected by conservative architects. But in the 1940s and 1950s some British architects—funded by the Colonial Office—began to experiment with design in west Africa and India. They used modernist techniques adapted to the warmer climates of those regions. But they ignored indigenous architectural practices and designers.

An exhibition looking at Tropical Modernism opened this weekend at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The show includes models, drawings, letters, photographs and film. Christopher Turner, the curator, aims to assess the architecture within the context of the anti-colonial movements of the time. The exhibition examines Tropical Modernism’s exoticist beginnings. But it also explores its later adoption by post-colonial [west African](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/a-new-era-for-west-african-architecture) and Indian architects.

### Kate Winslet plays a paranoid autocrat

Television shows often poke fun at political leaders. Series like “The Thick of It” and “Veep” [satirise the workings of government](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/08/17/what-happens-to-comedy-when-british-politics-becomes-a-joke). Others dramatise the dark sides of power: in shows like “House of Cards” politicians backstab and plot against each other. Frank Underwood, a scheming congressman played by Kevin Spacey, is especially memorable. Elena Vernham, a paranoid chancellor played by Kate Winslet, is set to join him in the ranks of chilling fictional leaders.

“The Regime”, a six-part series to be released on Sunday on HBO Original, recounts the goings-on over the course of a year in the palace of the ruler of an unnamed central European state. Ms Winslet plays the ruler, who leads a failing authoritarian regime. Will Tracy, one of the writers of HBO’s “Succession”, has written and produced the show. It brilliantly depicts populist authoritarianism—and the havoc it causes.

### Weekend profile: Jordan Bardella, the young president of France’s National Rally

Two years ago when Marine Le Pen temporarily handed the reins of her party to her protégé, Jordan Bardella, he was just 26 years old. Today the clean-shaven and besuited [Mr Bardella is the official president](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/25/how-marine-le-pen-is-preparing-for-power) of the hard-right National Rally (founded by Ms Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie, as the National Front). On Sunday he will join her in Marseille to launch the party’s campaign for elections to the European Parliament. Mr Bardella’s ascent has been as speedy as it is symbolic: the first non-Le Pen in charge, he embodies a younger generation that increasingly considers the once-pariah movement to be a political party like any other.

Born to parents of Italian origin, Mr Bardella grew up in social housing on the northern edge of Paris in the sprawling neighbourhood of Seine-Saint-Denis. Drawn as a teenager to Ms Le Pen, who emerged from the shadow of her father to take over the party in 2011, he abandoned his university degree to become a full-time hack. Pasting campaign posters and handing out flyers, Mr Bardella dabbled in local politics and worked his way up inside the party, joining Ms Le Pen’s campaign team for the 2017 presidential election.

Mr Bardella’s background is a useful asset for Ms Le Pen, who was brought up in a posh mansion outside Paris. He has experienced hardship and possesses an easy manner, free of the arrogance that a French elite education can bestow. Last December he was the only politician to feature on a list of the 50 favourite French personalities, alongside football players and rock stars. The clips on his TikTok account, of him railing against “mass immigration” and social benefits for foreigners or cheerfully drinking a beer, regularly draw over 1m views.

Mr Bardella belongs to a generation of loyalists who owe their lofty positions to Ms Le Pen. Fluent in debates, he seldom expresses a view that clashes with that of his mentor, although he has been more critical of Russia. “I don’t consider Jordan to be my son and I don’t treat him like my son,” snapped Ms Le Pen when asked if he enjoys an almost-filial tie. Emmanuel Macron recently appointed the 34-year-old Gabriel Attal to be prime minister, as a sort of anti-Bardella weapon. Were [Ms Le Pen to win the presidency](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/26/the-perils-of-a-le-pen-presidency) in 2027, she says, she would pick Mr Bardella as hers.
