The Biden administration lodged its first [antitrust](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/24/what-could-bring-apple-down) case against **Apple**, an American tech giant. America’s government accused the company of using its dominant position in the smartphone market to hamper the development of third-party apps, messaging services and payment systems. Apple said the case is “wrong on the facts and the law”. Its shares fell on the news.

**India’s** financial-crime agency arrested Arvind Kejriwal, an opposition leader and Delhi’s chief minister, for alleged corruption. The Enforcement Directorate, which is under control of the ruling **BJP**, leads money-laundering investigations. In January it arrested another opposition figure, [sparking claims](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/02/05/are-indias-corruption-police-targeting-narendra-modis-critics) that it was targeting the critics of Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, in the lead-up to the country’s elections in April.

Fighting at the [al-Shifa hospital](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/18/was-israels-attack-on-al-shifa-hospital-justified) in **Gaza City** intensified as an Israeli raid dragged into its third day. The Israel Defence Forces said that 140 Hamas fighters had been killed in or around the complex, suggesting a resurgence in the presence of militants in the north of the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile **Antony Blinken**, America’s secretary of state, met with Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s president, to discuss [proposals for a ceasefire](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/14/hopes-for-a-truce-in-gaza-give-way-to-fears-of-a-long-stalemate).

The **Swiss National Bank** cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.50%, sending the franc to an eight-month low against the euro. The SNB is the first major central bank to cut rates after an extended period of [monetary tightening](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/10/interest-rates-have-risen-sharply-but-is-monetary-policy-truly-tight). The decision follows a period of low inflation in Switzerland, where price rises have remained within the SNB’s target range of 0-2% for the last nine months.

A suicide bombing killed at least three people in **Afghanistan**, according to Taliban authorities, though independent media reported that the number of dead is over 20. The attack targeted a bank in Kandahar, the Taliban’s main seat of power. Afghanistan has been beset by suicide bombings in recent years, mostly perpetrated by [ISKP](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/08/27/what-is-the-islamic-state-khorasan-province), an affiliate of Islamic State.

**Turkey’s** central bank hiked its main interest rate by 5 percentage points, to 50%, in an effort to steady the lira. Price rises in [Turkey](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/11/turkeys-economy-has-improved-but-its-foreign-policy-is-still-messy) exceeded expectations in January and February, with an unexpected increase in consumer prices putting inflation on a path to exceed 70%. The bank’s decision surprised economists, who widely predicted that the bank would hold rates.

Surgeons in New York transplanted a **pig’s kidney** into the body of Richard Slayman, a 62-year-old man living with late-stage kidney disease. The organ had been gene-edited by eGenesis, a biotech company, to increase the safety of the transplant. The operation, which marks the first time a gene-edited organ has been used in such a procedure, builds on previous successes in [pig-to-human transplants](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/10/20/a-pig-kidney-has-been-successfully-transplanted-into-a-human-for-the-first-time).

### Trump’s paper windfall

After he was booted off Twitter (now X) and Facebook after the Capitol riot of January 6th 2021, Donald Trump started his own [social-media platform](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/20/donald-trump-tries-his-hand-with-meme-stocks). Truth Social was to be a home for “censored” voices, although it never took off beyond the MAGA crowd. It also loses money hand over fist. Regardless, it is now poised to go public. On Friday investors in a special-purpose acquisition company—essentially a listed pot of capital—will vote on whether to merge with Truth Social’s parent company. The combined entity will have a market capitalisation of about $6.3bn.

Wonderful news for Mr Trump, whose stake will be worth $4.1bn. The paper windfall will be of no help in his current predicament, however, since he cannot sell his shares for six months. By March 25th he must secure a bond for half-a-billion dollars to satisfy a judgment in his civil-fraud trial. No bond company will step up since he lacks enough cash as collateral. So he is begging an appeals court to reduce the bond.

### Britain and Australia boost their defence ties

David Cameron and Grant Shapps, Britain’s foreign and defence secretaries, meet their Australian counterparts, Penny Wong and Richard Marles, in Adelaide on Friday for security talks. On Thursday the two nations signed a defence co-operation agreement that makes it easier for their forces to operate in each other’s countries.

The ministers are expected to trumpet progress on AUKUS, a trilateral security agreement with America. Under [the pact](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/03/13/what-is-the-aukus-pact) Britain and Australia aim to manufacture nuclear-propelled submarines for Australia. Before those become ready, British and American subs will be deployed to a base in Western Australia.

Britain shares Australia’s concerns about China’s military buildup, and in an “Indo-Pacific tilt” has tried to boost trade with the region. However, Britain’s role in AUKUS gets barely a mention down under. Australia looks primarily to America for security. But with the possibility of a Trump presidency, Australians are increasingly concerned about the reliability of their main AUKUS partner.

### Germany’s marijuana drama

The Bundesrat, the upper house of Germany’s parliament, will vote on Friday on a long-awaited law to decriminalise marijuana. Its members represent the country’s 16 states, some of which oppose liberalisation. They cannot amend or block the bill. The more powerful lower house has already passed it, and it is due to take effect on April 1st. But the Bundesrat could shunt it off to a “mediation” committee, ensuring a long delay.

Cheering millions of marijuana users, the three-party governing coalition promised to [legalise the drug](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/11/european-cannabis-legalisation-moves-into-the-slow-dopey-lane) when it took power in 2021. Its bill would allow adults to carry up to 25g of marijuana, cultivate three plants at home and join registered clubs to grow more for private use. Psychologists, however, warn that strong new cannabis strains can damage mental health. Judges argue that thousands convicted under old laws will claim amnesty. Parrying such concerns, the government promises to strengthen drug counselling and to give judges help to handle the extra cases.

### Vodafone’s tie-up with Three under scrutiny

Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, a watchdog, has until Friday to complete the first phase of its investigation into a proposed tie-up between [Vodafone](https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/03/07/vodafone-tries-to-slim-its-way-back-to-health) and Three, two mobile networks. The joint venture between the rival operators will face a second, longer investigation lasting up to 32 weeks if the initial probe rules that the merger would hurt competition.

The blockbuster deal, which would combine two out of Britain’s four major mobile networks, will test regulators’ appetite for relaxing rules around telecoms mergers. Operators argue such deals can help fund costly rollouts of superfast 5G networks. Europe lags behind other regions in 5G coverage: 80% of Europe’s population had access to 5G at the end of 2023, compared with 89% in China and near-complete coverage in America, Japan and South Korea. As a sweetener, Vodafone says the combined business will invest £11bn ($13.9bn) in Britain’s 5G infrastructure over the next decade.

### The Indian Premier League returns

India’s festival of democracy, as its elections are often called, begins on April 19th. But for some Indians the more important festival begins this Friday. That is when the Chennai Super Kings take on the Royal Challengers Bengaluru to start off the latest Indian Premier League season. The 17th edition of the world’s most lucrative [domestic cricket contest](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/31/the-indian-premier-league-is-taking-over-global-cricket) has had to adjust to voting dates, but that will not put fans off.

Last year’s edition broke viewing records. This year Tata Group, a conglomerate, forked out a record 25bn rupees ($300m) to renew its sponsorship. At an auction ahead of the tournament teams spent around 2.3bn rupees on player purchases. Kolkata Knight Riders paid a record 250m rupees for Mitchell Starc, an Australian fast bowler. Still, KKR are not the bookies’ choice to win the league. They favour CSK, the defending champions, and the Mumbai Indians. But unlike the elections, which the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party will probably win with ease, the IPL will be a close contest.
