**France** will pull its troops and ambassador out of **Niger**, following [a coup](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/07/after-nigers-coup-the-drums-of-war-are-growing-louder) in the west African country in July. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, described Mohamed Bazoum, Niger’s elected president who is being held hostage by the coup’s leaders, as the “sole legitimate authority”. France, Niger’s former colonial power, has around 1,500 troops in the country to counter jihadist terrorism.

**Italy’s** defence minister criticised **German** plans to help finance charities that support **migrants** crossing the Mediterranean Sea into Europe. It is the latest spat within the EU over how best to stem the influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East. Germany’s foreign ministry countered that the country has a “legal, humanitarian and moral duty” to help rescue people at sea.

**Armenia’s** foreign minister told the UN General Assembly that international intervention was needed to stop ethnic cleansing in [Nagorno-Karabakh](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/21/azerbaijan-is-close-to-taking-control-of-nagorno-karabakh), days after **Azerbaijan** seized control of the besieged enclave. Armenian separatists said that the terms of a ceasefire, agreed on Wednesday, were being upheld as Azerbaijan moved to establish control of the region. Russia, which has peacekeepers in the area, said the separatists had surrendered weapons, including over 800 guns.

In **Kosovo** security forces surrounded about 30 gunmen who killed a police officer in what the authorities called a terrorist attack. Three of the gunmen were also killed in the shooting, which took place in the north of the country near the **Serbian** border, where many Kosovans are ethnic Serbs. There has been unrest in the region since May when Kosovan Albanian mayors were installed in several towns. Serbia does not recognise Kosovo.

Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group, said that **Israel** killed two people, including one of its fighters, during a raid on a refugee camp near Turkalm, a city in the **West Bank**. Israel described the raid as “counterterrorism activity”. Violence in the territory has escalated in recent months: in July Israel launched its [biggest raid in over 20 years](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/03/israel-launches-its-biggest-raid-on-the-west-bank-in-over-20-years) on a camp near the city of Jenin.

**Ukraine** said its large missile strike on the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea fleet in Crimea on Friday was timed to coincide with a meeting of Russian naval officials. Ukrainian military intelligence claimed that two Russian generals were injured in the attack. On Saturday Russia said that Ukraine had launched another missile strike on Sevastopol in Crimea. The Kremlin-installed governor of the peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, claimed that air-defence systems shot down a missile just off the coast, with debris falling near the shore.

**OSIRIS-REX**, an [American spacecraft](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66893661), dropped a capsule containing “soil” samples of Bennu, an asteroid, in the desert in Utah. The mission, which has been seven years in the making, is NASA’s first attempt to recover a piece of pure space rock. Scientists hope the samples’ chemistry will shed light on how planets were formed 4.5bn years ago.

### Business gloom in Germany

Germany’s Ifo institute, an economic-research outfit, releases its latest survey of business confidence (the Business Climate Index) on Monday. The state of mind of the country’s bosses is unlikely to provide much cheer, as the index will probably fall for the fifth consecutive month. German business leaders are mired in [pessimism](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Economist+-+Germany's+economy&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB893GB893&oq=The+Economist+-+Germany's+economy&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i22i29i30l4.7227j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) following a series of gloomy statistics on the state of the economy. Principally, they are concerned about an IMF forecast that it will probably be the only major economy to shrink this year.

Moreover, energy prices remain high, the government is cutting cumbersome red tape only slowly and selectively, the cold winter months are looming and the war in Ukraine is unlikely to end any time soon. Many companies cannot find skilled staff, or indeed any staff. But at least [businesses](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/09/14/robert-habeck-responds-to-the-economists-sick-man-of-europe-cover) are still hiring; order books remain full and unemployment remains low. None of that, however, is enough to lift the mood of general malaise.

### The BBC v Modi

The Delhi High Court is expected to begin hearing a defamation suit against the BBC on Monday over the broadcaster’s documentary on Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, which aired in January. Part of it examines Mr Modi’s time as chief minister of Gujarat, particularly his role in riots in which more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, were killed in 2002. Mr Modi has often been accused of not doing enough to stop the riots. He has always denied the allegations and was cleared of related charges by India’s Supreme Court in 2022.

Those who filed the suit argue that the programme cast a slur on India’s reputation and defames the prime minister and the judiciary. The Indian government blocked clips from it on social media. The BBC in India is now under investigation for alleged violation of foreign-exchange rules. The broadcaster stands by its reporting. But whatever the outcome of the defamation suit, its troubles in India are far from over.

### Another congressional map in Alabama

Third time lucky? A court-appointed “special master” in Alabama will be hoping so on Monday when he submits the third iteration of the state’s new congressional map. The first, drawn in 2021, was struck down by a federal court for diluting the power of black voters—a decision [upheld in June](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/08/the-supreme-court-says-alabamas-electoral-map-is-discriminatory) by the Supreme Court. The state legislature was tasked with creating an additional majority-black voting district or something “close to it”. Instead, in August, the Republican-controlled legislature submitted a revised map that merely increased the black-voting population in one district to 40%.

In September the same three-judge panel struck it down. Writing that they were “disturbed” by the legislature’s unwillingness to comply, they handed the reins to the special master, an attorney assigned to carry out the court’s orders.

The back-and-forth in Alabama is being closely watched. A similar lawsuit in Florida—alleging that the map created by the state legislature (with hefty contributions from Ron DeSantis, the governor) racially discriminates—goes to trial on Tuesday.

### America and the Marshall Islands

As America’s rivalry with China intensifies, so does the [strategic importance](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/25/america-is-lavishing-attention-on-pacific-island-states) of Pacific island nations. Its alliance with the Marshall Islands expires on September 30th, potentially leaving a gaping hole in its vast aerial and maritime security apparatus across the ocean. A meeting in Washington, DC on Monday of the US-Pacific Islands Forum Summit has thus assumed extra significance as President Joe Biden attempts to ink a new deal with his Marshallese opposite number, David Kabua.

In July, the Marshall Islands negotiated a 20-year, $2.2bn renewal of its alliance, or “compact of free association”, with America, giving America’s armed forces access to the islands, although the full details have still to be worked out and ratified by parliament. To get the deal, the Marshallese gave up on efforts to secure additional compensation for islands badly affected by American nuclear-missile testing in the 1940s and 1950s. Only days later, however, the Senate awarded more compensation to nuclear-testing victims on the United States mainland and Guam, an unincorporated territory. For the Marshallese, the optics were poor. Mr Biden has work to do.

### Using bacteria to detect mines

Landmines are a devastating and enduring consequence of war. In 2021 the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a pressure group, reported over 5,500 deaths and injuries from mines. An estimated 110m mines remain in the ground.

Various methods exist to detect them—from human minesweepers to radar-wielding robots—but they can be costly and risky. [In 2017](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2017/04/20/using-fluorescent-bacteria-to-find-landmines), researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggested using modified bacteria that fluoresce when exposed to explosive vapours. This method requires scattering bacteria-containing beads in suspected areas, waiting a day for the explosive fumes to reach the bacteria, and then shining a laser to reveal any bacteria that has encountered explosives.

Now those researchers have collaborated with Enzymit, a biotech company, to improve the technology. Their new system, detailed in *Computational and Structural Biotechnology,* a journal, is faster and five times more sensitive. Enzymit plans “limited deployment in combat scenarios as early as next year.”
