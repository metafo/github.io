Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Chuck Schumer**, the Democratic Senate majority leader and America’s highest-ranking Jewish politician, called on **Israel** to hold fresh elections. Mr Schumer said that the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, tolerates too many civilian deaths in Gaza and “no longer fits the needs of Israel”. He added that the country “cannot survive if it becomes a pariah”. President Joe Biden is also [exasperated with Mr Netanyahu](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/05/joe-biden-is-exasperated-by-israel-but-will-not-stop-its-war)—who he recently said was “hurting Israel more than helping” it—but has not called for Israel’s leader to be replaced.

**Joe Biden** said he opposed a [proposed takeover](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/15/the-row-over-us-steel-shows-the-new-meaning-of-national-security) of **US Steel** by Nippon Steel. In December Japan’s biggest steelmaker agreed to buy the American company in a deal worth nearly $15bn. But the agreement met fierce criticism from unions and politicians, partly on national-security grounds. Donald Trump, Mr Biden’s rival in the presidential election, has said he would “block it instantaneously”.

The prosecutors trying one of **Donald Trump’s** cases—in which he is accused of falsifying documents—said they were open to [delaying the trial](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/22/why-those-who-wish-to-see-trump-jailed-soon-will-be-disappointed) by 30 days. Alvin Bragg, the New York district attorney, said that, after receiving a late batch of documents, his office would not oppose Mr Trump’s efforts to push back the trial, scheduled to start on March 25th. (Mr Trump denies wrongdoing.)

**SpaceX**, a firm founded by Elon Musk, launched its [vast Starship rocket](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/03/14/elon-musks-starship-reaches-orbit-on-its-third-attempt) from its base in Texas. The test appears to have been more successful than [two missions carried out last year](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/11/22/spacex-tests-starship-and-prepares-to-face-down-amazon). The two-stage rocket completed its separation manoeuvre and entered space. SpaceX said it lost contact with the rocket on re-entry into the atmosphere. It was supposed to splashdown in the Indian Ocean.

The **International Energy Agency** revised its forecast for global oil-demand growth to 1.3m barrels a day in 2024. That is an increase of 110,000 b/d compared with a forecast last month, but well below 2.3m b/d in 2023. The world’s energy watchdog also lowered its forecast on global supply growth as [OPEC+ countries](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/29/an-unruly-opec-is-causing-problems-for-russia-and-saudi-arabia) cut production.

**France’s** lower house of parliament approved a draft law that sets limitations on fast-fashion companies. The legislation would impose an environmental charge on cheap garments and make it difficult for brands to advertise. If it passes the Senate, the law—claimed to be a world first—could cause headaches for firms such as [Shein and Temu](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/15/how-worried-should-amazon-be-about-shein-and-temu).

On Wednesday the British government introduced legislation to stop the *Telegraph* and the *Spectator* being controlled by a foreign state. *The Economist* [has investigated](https://www.economist.com/interactive/britain/2024/03/14/the-ancient-deal-that-saved-the-barclays) **Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay**, the twin brothers who bought the titles in 2004, and how their business escaped bankruptcy in the 1970s. As debate rages about who should own the news media, our investigation asks whether the brothers’ empire was built on a fraud.

### The collapse of India’s fintech star

For years, Paytm was the trailblazer in India’s booming fintech scene. The startup pioneered [digital payments](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/05/15/a-digital-payments-revolution-in-india) in the country, accumulating 100m active users and attracting billions in venture capital. In 2021 it went public at a valuation of $20bn, in what was then India’s biggest-ever IPO. These days, though, the company is struggling.

Paytm’s share price has slumped amid concerns over its profitability. And in trying to attract more users it has cut corners, angering regulators. On Thursday the firm will shut its banking arm on the orders of India’s central bank because of “persistent non-compliances”, such as opening accounts without proper identification.

The crackdown will have far-reaching implications. Users with Paytm bank accounts, including many small businesses, will have to withdraw their money. Many of the other 7,000 fintech startups in India may have to tone down their similarly aggressive approaches to recruiting customers. Paytm’s success story has become a cautionary tale.

### Russia’s sham election

On Friday voting begins in Russia’s presidential election. The result is not in doubt: Vladimir Putin will win another six-year term. He controls the media and has closed civil-society groups. (Golos, Russia’s only independent election-monitoring organisation, has been designated a “foreign agent”.) Opposition figures have been silenced, imprisoned and killed. [Boris Nadezhdin](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/01/meet-boris-nadezhdin-vladimir-putins-brave-challenger), an anti-war politician, collected enough signatures to gain a place on the ballot, but was banned from standing. On February 16th [Alexei Navalny](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/22/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity), Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, died in the Siberian penal colony where he was incarcerated on spurious charges.

In that context, holding the vote may seem pointless. But the exercise is important to Mr Putin. His rule relies on carefully maintaining the appearance of popular support. The election is a [ritualistic expression](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/12/russians-go-to-the-polls-in-a-sham-election-for-their-president) of that approval. It will embolden the president to continue his war in Ukraine and his campaign of repression at home.

### American consumers’ so-so sentiment

Their extreme gloom has dissipated, but Americans are still far from enthused by the economy. The latest reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index—a closely watched indicator—will be released on Friday.

Last month the index dipped to 76.9—a level historically consistent with weak growth. That was down slightly from the start of the year, though [up strongly](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/02/16/american-consumers-are-finally-cheering-up) from early 2023. For the Biden administration, the public mood has been a source of frustration. America’s recent economic growth has been [impressive](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/14/americas-extraordinary-economy-keeps-defying-the-pessimists), but many people still seem more focused on high inflation than on the strong labour market. Analysts argue that political partisanship may be clouding survey responses and that it will take a while longer for people to digest the surge in prices that hit primarily in 2022. In this context a modest improvement in sentiment may be the best Joe Biden can hope for.

### Macron, Scholz and Tusk meet

When Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, visits Berlin on Friday he will attempt to [mend fences](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/29/france-and-germany-are-at-loggerheads-over-military-aid-to-ukraine) with Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor. The pair differ in temperament and political instinct—and in recent weeks they have also disagreed over the war in Ukraine.

Taking the Germans by surprise, at the end of February Mr Macron publicly mused that Western countries might send ground troops to Ukraine. Mr Scholz immediately rejected the idea. German officials were especially irritated by such hawkish talk as France has provided only €635m ($693m) in military aid to Ukraine, while Germany has delivered or promised €17.7bn, calculates the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (figures the French government contests.). Messrs Macron and Scholz will later be joined by Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, for a meeting of the Weimar Triangle, a geopolitical forum born in 1991 after the end of the cold war. Poland and Germany are particularly keen to resuscitate it.

### Frida Kahlo, in her own words

Frida Kahlo is one of Mexico’s greatest cultural exports. She is Latin America’s most expensive artist, and the Blue House, her home in Coyoacán, is one of the most visited museums in Mexico City. Yet [Kahlo](https://www.economist.com/1843/2018/06/21/the-real-frida-kahlo) is also revered as a feminist icon in a way oddly detached from her life and work. Her ubiquitous likeness—replete with her characteristic unibrow—adorns all manner of trinkets, including plates and socks.

“Frida”, a documentary released on Prime Video this week, uses Kahlo’s diaries and letters to tell her story in her own words. It covers the bus crash that nearly killed her at the age of 18, her tempestuous marriage to Diego Rivera, a fellow painter, and her affairs (among them one with Leon Trotsky). Throughout, her paintings and drawings are brought to life with careful animation. It is a vivid portrait of a singular artist, who strove to portray the world “through no one else’s eyes” but her own.
