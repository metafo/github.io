## The world in brief

### December 1, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Hamas** released six additional hostages, bringing today’s total to eight, the Israel Defence Forces announced. **Israel** is expected to release 30 Palestinians in turn. Earlier Israel and Hamas agreed to [extend a truce](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas), which began on Friday, by at least one day. At a news conference in Tel Aviv, Antony Blinken (pictured, left), America’s secretary of state, said Israel must put in place “humanitarian civilian-protection plans” before fighting resumes. Israel agreed with the approach, he said.

**Henry Kissinger**, America’s former secretary of state, [died](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2023/11/30/henry-kissinger-never-quite-belonged-where-he-wanted-to-be) aged 100. A Nobel peace-prize winner, he [shaped world affairs](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/17/henry-kissinger-explains-how-to-avoid-world-war-three) under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, and oversaw America’s withdrawal from Vietnam. His “shuttle diplomacy” helped stabilise the Middle East after the Yom Kippur war in 1973. But his legacy is controversial: in the 1970s he supported Pakistan while it carried out massacres in what is now Bangladesh.

**OPEC+**, a group of oil-exporting countries, reportedly agreed to make additional oil-supply cuts of 1m barrels per day. [Saudi Arabia](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/29/an-unruly-opec-is-causing-problems-for-russia-and-saudi-arabia) will also extend its voluntary cuts of 1m barrels, announced in June, into next year. The move is intended to support the market, as global demand is forecast to slow. The cartel announced that Brazil will join OPEC+ from January 2024.

National leaders at **COP28** finalised a [“loss and damage” fund](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage), which would see rich countries compensate poor ones for the damage caused by climate-related disasters. The deal was first announced during COP27. The UAE, the summit’s hosts, pledged $100m to the fund; other contributors include Britain, Germany and Japan.

**Meta** said it shut down a network of almost 4,800 fake Chinese accounts that sought to polarise American voters ahead of the 2024 election. The company, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the accounts impersonated ordinary Americans and shared highly partisan posts from politicians and news outlets. A smaller Russian network was also shut down.

**Russia’s** highest court approved a request by the justice ministry to label the “international public LGBT movement” as “**extremist**” and ban its activities. Russia has increasingly [cracked down](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/03/26/the-new-russian-cult-of-war) on LGBT rights: in 2013 it adopted a law banning “the propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” aimed at minors. The measure was extended to all age groups last year.

**Shane MacGowan**, the frontman of **The Pogues**, a Celtic punk band, died aged 65. He joined his first punk band, The Nipple Erectors (later The Nips), in 1977 and often wrote about the experiences of the Irish diaspora. The Pogues spearheaded interest in [Irish traditional music](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/04/03/irish-folk-music-is-enjoying-a-revival) by being wildly untraditional in their approach. The band’s best known song is “Fairytale of New York”.

### The growing chaos at Elon Musk’s X

X, formerly Twitter, may not survive, says [Elon Musk](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/09/12/impulsive-and-self-destructive-elon-musk-as-depicted-in-a-new-book), its owner. Companies that pay to advertise on the social-media platform were already moving out when Mr Musk told them to “go fuck [themselves]” this week. He was responding to companies such as Disney, which stopped paying for marketing on the site after Mr Musk’s apparent endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory in a post (he has since apologised).

X stands to lose up to $75m in advertising revenue by the end of the year, according to internal documents seen by the *New York Times*. That is a fraction of the company’s yearly revenue, but could hinder its ability to service the vast debts accrued to fund Mr Musk’s takeover. The firm fears more advertisers could join Apple, IBM, Disney and dozens more in pulling their paid presence from the platform during the holiday season, typically its strongest quarter. Users may follow suit.

### An AUKUS gathering in California

Defence ministers from America, Australia and Britain meet in California on Friday to advance their countries’ ambitious [AUKUS](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/03/16/the-aukus-pact-is-a-model-for-western-allies) partnership. Under the agreement’s first “pillar” Australia will receive nuclear-powered submarines, designed by Britain with American propulsion. But the first boats will not arrive until the 2040s. In the interim, America’s Congress worries about selling Australia Virginia-class boats, fearing its own navy will be left short. Meanwhile, attention turns to hastening the development of technology under pillar two, from hypersonic missiles to artificial intelligence, drones and more.

AUKUS aims to strengthen the three allies against the likes of China and Russia. But their immediate foe is [paralysis](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/12/paralysis-in-congress-makes-america-a-dysfunctional-superpower). Congress has yet to pass a [supplemental](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/27/ukraines-new-enemy-war-fatigue-in-the-west) budget that would not only provide aid to Ukraine and Israel, but also invest $3.4bn in America’s submarine industrial base. And to make it all possible, Congress must set aside rules, such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, that hamper co-operation between the allies.

### El Salvador’s president pushes for a second term

On Friday Nayib Bukele will step down as president of El Salvador so that he can be re-elected. His plan is contentious: in 2021 he asked the Supreme Court to reinterpret a constitutional ban on two consecutive terms. The judges, appointed under Mr Bukele, ruled that he could run again if he were not in power for the six months before elections in February. He will appoint a temporary replacement to run the country in his absence.

Despite the controversy, the populist president is likely to win with a huge majority. A poll in August found that almost 70% of Salvadoreans plan to vote for Mr Bukele. His popularity is driven by his [crackdown on crime](https://www.economist.com/films/2023/07/21/inside-el-salvadors-war-on-crime). Homicide rates have plummeted and neighbourhoods have been freed from the stranglehold of gangs. Yet the clampdown has also breached human rights and laws—a hallmark of a president who looks increasingly keen to stay in power for as long as possible.

### Drought chokes the Panama Canal

Travelling between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is becoming trickier. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP), the body which runs the waterway, has recently been [cutting](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/11/23/severe-drought-is-constraining-the-panama-canal) the number of daily crossings. On Friday the figure will drop from 24 to 22. That is less than 60% of capacity. The cuts are driven by the need to save water, which powers the canal’s 12 locks. Panama’s worst drought in 70 years means that reservoirs feeding the canal are running dry.

Ships with a pre-booked slot face extended waits; those without a booking risk “indefinite delays”, warns the ACP. Alternative routes are long and costly, so many vessels are choosing to wait. Some are paying huge sums to skip the queue. (One company paid nearly $4m on top of the standard transit fees of around $400,000.) There is little prospect of getting the canal moving at full capacity again: Panama’s dry season is approaching and the ACP has scheduled more transit cuts.

### Peter Gabriel’s triumphant return

Some septuagenarian rock stars are content to exploit their past successes. When they perform they scatter a few new songs into sets consisting mainly of familiar crowd-pleasers. Not [Peter Gabriel](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/06/22/on-a-new-tour-peter-gabriel-is-as-inventive-as-ever). The British rocker has just concluded an international tour centred on previously unheard material. On Friday those songs are released on “i/o”, Mr Gabriel’s first album of original compositions in 21 years.

Though the songs are new, “i/o” harks back to Mr Gabriel’s first four solo albums, on which he defined a highly influential form of globalised art-pop. It feels warmer than those early records, which often dealt with feelings of alienation. That means it should also please fans of his later records, such as “So”, released in 1986, which brought him huge commercial success. The result is an album that deals with big ideas about humanity’s place in the world but is also likely to have broad appeal.
