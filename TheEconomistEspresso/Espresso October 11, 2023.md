Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

President Joe Biden denounced **Hamas’s** attack on **Israel—**the bloodiest since those by Egypt and Syria 50 years ago—as “evil”. He also confirmed that American citizens are among the people taken hostage by the group, which he likened to Islamic State, and said that 14 Americans were killed. Israel said it had hit 200 targets in Gaza overnight, and recovered the bodies of 1,500 [Hamas fighters](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/09/after-its-brutal-attack-hamas-is-calculating-its-next-move) in its territory. Hamas warned that it would start executing [Israeli hostages](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/08/israeli-hostages-now-face-a-terrifying-ordeal) if Israel continued to bomb civilian houses in Gaza without warning.

The **UN’s humanitarian chief**, Volker Turk, condemned Israel’s blockade of Gaza, which has cut the enclave off from supplies of food, electricity and fuel. Mr Turk said that a “siege” endangering civilian lives was prohibited by [international](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/09/hamass-carnage-upends-joe-bidens-plans-for-the-middle-east) humanitarian law; as were the abductions by Hamas of hostages from Israel. Nearly 200,000 people, or a tenth of the population of Gaza, have fled their homes.

**George Santos**, the congressman from New York [notorious](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/17/george-santos-is-the-congressman-america-deserves) for his falsehoods, was indicted on ten additional counts. He is accused of lying to the Federal Election Commission, a regulatory agency, about how much money his campaign raised, and unlawfully charging donors’ credit cards. He did not immediately comment on those charges; he has pleaded not guilty to [earlier ones](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/17/what-do-george-santos-r-kelly-and-fifa-have-in-common), including wire fraud.

**Sam Bankman-Fried**, the disgraced founder of FTX, “directed” his employees to steal customer deposits from the failed crypto exchange, according to testimony from Caroline Ellison, a former executive. Mr Bankman-Fried is [on trial](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/03/decoding-sam-bankman-fried-alleged-titan-of-crypto-conmen) for fraud and misappropriating clients’ money (he has pleaded not guilty). Prosecutors offered Ms Ellison, who also dated Mr Bankman-Fried, a plea deal in exchange for cooperating.

**PepsiCo** said that the growing popularity of [weight-loss medicines](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/03/02/a-new-class-of-drugs-for-weight-loss-could-end-obesity) had not slimmed down its bottom line, as it reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. The new drugs [suppress appetite](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/03/03/how-the-new-generation-of-weight-loss-drugs-work), inducing people to snack less. Last week Walmart, a supermarket chain, said that Americans were already buying less food. PepsiCo said it would offer health-minding consumers portion-control packages and sugarless drinks.

**Poland’s** two highest-ranking generals quit days before a [tight election](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/05/after-a-brutal-campaign-poland-gets-ready-to-vote). The resignations dealt a blow to the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party which has sought to present itself as a guarantor of national security. Tomasz Piotrowski, operational commander of the armed forces, clashed with the defence ministry after it emerged that a Russian missile landed in Poland unnoticed last year. Replacements have already been appointed.

Scientists made chickens that are more resistant to **bird flu** by [editing their DNA](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2022/04/26/how-crispr-cas9-gene-editing-is-transforming-healthcare-and-agriculture-a-decade-after-its-discovery). After exposing the edited chickens to a low dose of the flu, strains of which can be lethal in humans, only one out of ten became infected. However, at 1000 times the dose, the virus adapted and caused some breakthrough infection. The researchers say lasting resistance may take multiple edits.

### Israel’s next steps

On Wednesday Israel’s preparations for a ground invasion of Gaza will intensify. Airstrikes have hit more than 2,000 targets in the Palestinian enclave; military reservists, with armour, are gathering at staging points. The Pentagon began delivering additional munitions earlier this week.

As the build-up proceeds, Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and Benny Gantz, the opposition leader, are expected to continue talks to form an emergency unity government, a temporary arrangement with members from the ruling coalition and the opposition. Mr Netanyahu has so far appeared to reject conditional offers from Mr Gantz, who wants assurance that Israel’s parliament will not pass legislation while the emergency government rules. Mr Gantz has also suggested that military experience should be a requirement to join a “war cabinet”—experience that many of Mr Netanyahu’s [right-wing coalition](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/29/israels-new-government-is-the-most-right-wing-ever) members lack.

The road ahead is undoubtedly grim. Already more than 900 Israelis and 800 Palestinians have been killed; an invasion of Gaza will mean even greater casualties on both sides.

### Hizbullah weighs its options

Days into Hamas’s war with Israel, fears of a regional conflict remain high. Missiles and shells have been flying across Israel’s northern border in both directions as Hizbullah, an Iran-backed Lebanese Shia militia, attacked Israeli positions in the Golan Heights.

Analysts dismiss these merely as efforts to assuage the movement’s hotheads, who want to join the fight. But many Lebanese fear a broader conflagration. The coastal highway is clogged with cars heading north. And, like Israel, Hizbullah has announced a mass call-up of forces. Threats of war increase the risks of a mistake—like that which triggered a war between Israel and Hizbullah in 2006.

Hizbullah must prove that it remains as much of a resistance force as Hamas. But Iran’s supreme leader, [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/25/who-will-be-irans-next-leader), needs to keep Hizbullah’s powder dry if it is to remain a deterrent against Israel. He has also authorised direct talks between Iran’s nuclear negotiators and America. To maximise his bargaining power, he might not be averse to some muscle-flexing.

### Republicans try to choose a House speaker

On Wednesday Republicans in America’s House of Representatives will try to [pick a speaker](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/09/how-americas-house-of-representatives-will-choose-a-speaker). The post has been vacant since October 3rd, when eight GOP rebels, plus all Democrats, [voted to oust](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/04/the-sacking-of-kevin-mccarthy-will-make-supporting-ukraine-harder) the Republican Kevin McCarthy in an unprecedented dethroning.

The identity of his successor is uncertain. The victor needs 217 votes; the Republicans have just 221 representatives. Two have said they are candidates: Steve Scalise, the conservative House majority leader; and Jim Jordan, the co-founder of the obstructionist [Freedom Caucus](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/01/09/what-is-the-house-freedom-caucus). Mr McCarthy also seems interested in regaining his job, and has some support.

The point of the internal election on Wednesday is to decide which Republican the party will put forward for approval by the full House. The nominee will be decided by a simple majority. But the memory of Mr McCarthy’s drawn-out election in January—which took 15 rounds of votes—haunts Republicans. So they are hoping for near-unanimity on Wednesday, to ensure a smooth vote in the full House. That, however, looks unlikely.

### Fashionable Birken-stocks

When Greta Gerwig’s Barbie swapped her high heels for a pair of corkbed sandals in one of this summer’s biggest blockbusters, it was a social-media sensation. The nifty product placement confirmed the full evolution of Birkenstock.

In 2021 L Catterton, a private-equity firm backed by LVMH, a French luxury giant, acquired the 249-year-old family-owned German firm and helped the peddler of frumpy $100 sandals position itself as a high-fashion brand. (Pairs from a collaboration with Dior are selling for $1,100.) On Wednesday, the company will float on the New York Stock Exchange. Its initial public offering values the company at around $10bn.

Birkenstock’s reboot as the cool clog is part of a broader popularisation of casual fashion, spurred in large part by pandemic lockdowns. Other comfy-chic shoe brands like Crocs, Teva and Uggs have also had a boost. But as Birkenstock eyes an expansion into the largely untapped Asian market, shareholders must hope it won’t be tripped up by a volatile fashion cycle and supply bottlenecks.

### Gilberto Gil’s last dance in London

When Gilberto Gil stepped on stage at the Barbican Hall in London last summer he began his set with “Barato Total”, a song he wrote in the 1970s for fellow Brazilian musician [Gal Costa](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/16/gal-costa-made-music-in-pursuit-of-freedom). Ms Costa was also booked to perform in London last year, but cancelled because of her failing health. She died in November at the age of 77. As a generation of musicians associated with Brazil’s “Tropicália” movement enters its twilight years, their live performances feel increasingly precious.

Mr Gil, 81, says that Wednesday’s performance at the Royal Albert Hall will be his last-ever London show. His bond with the city is strong; it became his home in 1969 after Brazil’s military junta forced him to flee. These days the city has one of the largest Brazilian populations outside of South America. Expect the crowd to swell with colour, emotion and joy—characteristics of Mr Gil’s music.
