Four schools-turned-shelters run by the UN in **Gaza** have been damaged by bombardement in less than 24 hours, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said. The schools were sheltering almost 20,000 people; one of them is at the **Jabalia** [Refugee Camp](https://www.economist.com/interactive/the-economist-explains/2023/11/02/why-gazas-refugee-camps-vulnerable-jabalia) in north Gaza, where the Hamas-run health ministry says at least 195 have been killed by Israeli air strikes this week. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said that his country’s forces are “at the height of the battle”, having pushed deeper into Gaza city. The Israel Defence Forces said they have killed more than 130 Hamas fighters during ground operations.

**Sam Bankman-Fried** was convicted of defrauding customers of **FTX**, his [failed crypto exchange](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/03/decoding-sam-bankman-fried-alleged-titan-of-crypto-conmen). A federal jury in New York found him guilty on all seven counts, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. [Mr Bankman-Fried](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/17/the-failure-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-will-leave-deep-scars) faces a maximum of 110 years in prison; he is due to be sentenced in March.

**Storm Ciarán** killed at least seven people after lashing north-west Europe with record-breaking wind speeds of up to 200 km per hour. Fatalities were reported in France, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands and Germany. About 1.2m households were without power in France on Thursday and Britain issued more than 200 flood alerts. Storm Ciarán is a so-called “weather bomb”, meaning a storm that rapidly intensifies.

**American** labour productivity grew by an annualised rate of 4.7% in the third quarter, the most in three years. The average cost of labour per unit of output fell by 0.8%. This suggests that companies are ramping up attempts to improve efficiency, which will support economic growth and help to dampen the inflationary impacts of rising [wages](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/15/wage-price-spirals-are-far-scarier-in-theory-than-in-practice).

António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, called for urgent “frameworks” to deal with the dangers associated with **artificial intelligence**. At an AI safety summit in Britain Mr Guterres warned that without [regulation](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/24/the-world-wants-to-regulate-ai-but-does-not-quite-know-how), the technology could be used by “criminals or even terrorists”. On Wednesday America, China and the EU were among more than two dozen signatories to a “world-first” agreement to tackle the risks of AI.

**Myanmar’s** junta relinquished control of a town near its border with Yunnan province in southern China after fighting with armed rebels. A spokesperson confirmed that all government and security operations had left the town of Chinshwehaw, a significant trading post in Shan state in northern Myanmar. The junta said that [ethnic rebel groups](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/04/15/who-are-myanmars-ethnic-militias) attacked energy and transport infrastructure across the state in recent days.

The American Ornithological Society said that it would [rename](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/09/21/on-the-troubles-of-naming-species) around 80 **bird species** in North America. The organisation’s president said that some of the names have negative historical associations that could stop some people from being able to “enjoy and study them freely”. The renaming process has already begun. In 2020 the McCown longspur—after a Confederate general—became the thick-billed longspur.

### Figure of the day: 

**9,300**, the number of emergency calls that London’s Metropolitan Police Service received in a single day in April—a new record. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/11/01/londoners-can-no-longer-rely-on-the-police-to-handle-mental-health-emergencies).

### Hizbullah’s leader breaks his silence

On Friday Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of [Hizbullah](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-hizbullah), an Iranian-backed militia based in Lebanon, is expected to make his first public comments since the war between Israel and Hamas began. The militia has posted a series of “teaser” videos ahead of his address, which will commemorate Hizbullah fighters who have been killed in intermittent clashes with Israeli forces near the border.

Many fear that a speech by Mr Nasrallah could engender an escalation in the conflict. There are already unwelcome signs. The militia has ramped up its attacks on Israel ahead of the speech, firing missiles towards the country’s north. On Thursday the *Wall Street Journal* reported that American officials believe that Wagner, a Russian paramilitary group, could provide Hizbullah with an air-defence system. America has repeatedly warned Hizbullah—which has stockpiled 150,000 missiles—against opening a second front in the war. It is not clear whether Mr Nasrallah will heed the warning.

### Japan’s PM in the Philippines

Kishida Fumio, Japan’s prime minister, arrives in Manila on Friday for talks with the Philippine president, [Ferdinand Marcos](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/06/29/by-electing-another-marcos-filipinos-show-they-have-forgotten-history). They want to tighten security ties, in order to strengthen their [trilateral partnership with America](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/21/the-philippines-proximity-to-taiwan-makes-it-central-to-western-strategy), formed to resist Chinese strategic expansion in the western Pacific. That expansion has already impinged on the Philippines. The country’s maritime security forces are relatively weak and can do little to deter Chinese forces from occupying or blockading parts of the South China Sea, even those where international law gives the Philippines sovereign rights.

Japanese-supplied planes, ships and radar are making the Philippines a sturdier ally. Mr Kishida and Mr Marcos envisage an accord allowing their countries’ forces access to each other’s territory for joint training and operations. Equivalent agreements allow American forces access to Japan and the Philippines: an American aircraft-carrier, based in Japan, was anchored in Manila Bay until just before Mr Kishida’s visit, showing the sort of might the coalition can wield.

### A redesign at BMW

In recent years the styling of BMWs, in particular the vast grilles on the front of the cars, has divided opinion. Not so the firm’s financial performance. Third-quarter results, released on Friday, should reassure investors that the Bavarian giant knows what it is doing when it comes to other aspects of its business. The company sells a bigger share of its cars to [China](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/04/14/cars-with-chinese-characteristics) than do its competitors, and growth there is slowing. Nevertheless, the firm will probably maintain its forecast that it will sell some 2.5m vehicles globally in 2023, around 5% more than last year. Profits will also probably remain high as, in common with other carmakers, the company has concentrated on manufacturing higher-margin cars.

The carmaker is also on course for [electric vehicles](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/04/14/an-electric-shock) to make up 15% of sales. But despite BMW’s strong brand, its growing EV business offers slimmer margins than its internal combustion engine cars. Still, at least the critics are slowly coming round to its new house style.

### America’s relentless labour market

At first glance it will look like a sharp slowdown for the American workforce. Figures released on Friday are expected to show that the country added about 180,000 jobs in October, down from 340,000 in September. But on closer inspection it will be testament to the continued strength of the [American economy](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/29/americas-economy-is-booming-why-arent-its-bosses-happier). The strike at Detroit’s three big automakers, now resolved, will account for about 30,000 lost jobs last month; they will return this month.

Adding those back in, more than 200,000 Americans will have found jobs—higher than the monthly average in the three years before the pandemic. That should suffice to keep the unemployment rate at 3.8%, close to a five-decade low. The worry stemming from this resilience is that it may push up wages, feeding into price pressures. Investors will thus pay close attention to the details about hourly earnings, to see whether wage inflation is gathering pace.

### The wrong way to have sex

For its first half hour, Molly Manning Walker’s debut film—“[How To Have Sex](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/23/how-to-have-sex-is-among-the-standouts-at-cannes-film-festival)”—could be mistaken for a gross-out teen comedy. Its heroines are three English schoolgirls who set out to have “the best holiday ever” by wearing as little as possible and drinking as much as possible in the [deafening nightclubs](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/01/what-can-clean-up-magaluf) of Malia, Crete. One of the girls, played by Mia McKenna-Bruce, feels under pressure to lose her virginity, not just from her friends and the boys in an adjacent hotel suite, but by the hedonistic atmosphere of the whole resort.

The film, which won a prize at Cannes in May, and comes out in Britain on Friday, is one of the year’s finest. Its subtle shift from knockabout farce to dark coming-of-age drama examines the complexity of consent and responsibility. Beyond cinemas, it could well be played in schools, travel offices, and in every home with a teenager in it.
