Mass demonstrations took place in Sana’a after **America** and **Britain** launched strikes against the **Houthis**, a Iran-backed Yemeni [militant group](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112175658/https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/12/who-are-the-houthis-the-group-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea) which has been attacking cargo ships in the Red Sea. The Houthis promised to retaliate, saying there would be a “heavy price” for the strikes. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, accused America and Britain of intending to turn the Red Sea into a “sea of blood”. Oil prices spiked by 4.3% in trading this morning, rising above $80 per barrel.

**Israel** delivered its defence at the **International Court of Justice** against a charge of committing [genocide](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112175658/https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/10/how-the-term-genocide-is-misused-in-the-israel-hamas-war) in **Gaza**. Israel said that the case put forward by South Africa on Thursday presented a “distorted factual and legal picture”, ignoring the lethal [attacks ](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112175658/https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-attack-was-the-bloodiest-in-israels-history)which Hamas, a militant group, carried out on October 7th. Israel vehemently denies South Africa’s charge, arguing that it is fighting a war of self-defence.

**China** brokered a ceasefire deal in **Myanmar** designed to bring an end to months of fighting between the country’s military junta and an alliance of [rebel groups](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112175658/https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/16/myanmars-junta-suffers-startling-defeats) in the country’s north. Their recent offensive, which led to intense fighting near the border with China, posed the biggest threat to the regime since it took power in a coup in 2021.

The world’s largest asset management firm, **BlackRock**, announced it would buy **Global Infrastructure Partners** for around $12.5bn in cash and stock. Acquiring the investment fund will mark BlackRock’s biggest purchase since it bought the asset management arm of Barclays, a bank, in 2009. The move will significantly expand BlackRock’s presence in [fast-growing markets](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112175658/https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/04/27/asset-managers-control-a-growing-share-of-societys-essentials) for energy, transportation, and digital infrastructure.

**Finnish** border guards said they arrested 11 Iranian men who illegally entered the country from **Russia**. They crossed the closed border by travelling through the densely forested frontier, claiming asylum after being taken into custody. The incident will [increase tensions](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112175658/https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/11/14/russia-is-stoking-tension-with-ukraine-and-the-eu) between Russia and Finland, which accuses Moscow of pushing migrants towards its border in order to destabilise the EU.

**Argentina’s annual inflation rate** climbed to 211% in December—the biggest year-on-year increase in consumer prices since 1991, when the country emerged from a period of hyperinflation. The monthly inflation rate reached 25.5%, slightly lower than expected; [Javier Milei](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112175658/https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/12/21/argentinas-javier-milei-begins-his-radical-experiment-in-libertarian-rule), the president, sharply devalued the peso shortly after taking office. Mr Milei has promised tough austerity measures to try to curb inflation.

**Russian** holiday-goers are set to be the first known tourists allowed into North Korea since it closed its borders as a pandemic response in early 2020. A five-day jaunt was arranged by an agency in Primorsky Krai after the eastern region’s governor visited the hermit kingdom’s capital for talks. The countries pledged closer ties after [a series of meetings in September](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112175658/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/13/the-dangers-posed-by-a-deal-between-russia-and-north-korea).

### Constitutional crisis in Ankara

Turkey’s main opposition, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), cancelled a rally, originally scheduled to take place on Sunday in Ankara, intended to show support for the country’s constitutional court. The court is fending off challenges from both another branch of the judiciary and the government. The CHP said its decision was made out of respect for the nine Turkish soldiers killed in a cross-border operation against Kurdish insurgents.

The rally has been called off, but the judicial crisis remains. On two occasions, most recently on December 21st, the constitutional court ordered the release of one of Turkey’s best-known [political prisoners](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/04/30/a-turkish-court-sentences-activist-osman-kavala-to-life-in-prison), Can Atalay, only for the Supreme Court of Cassation, a lower court, to refuse to comply. Mr Atalay, an MP from a small hard-left opposition party, was sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment on trumped-up charges of plotting a coup over his involvement in protests a decade ago. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, called him a “terrorist” and accused the top court of making “many mistakes”.

The CHP’s [new leader](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/03/09/turkeys-opposition-has-picked-its-man), Ozgur Ozel, has warned of a “coup attempt”. Mr Erdogan, in power since 2003, has already [hobbled Turkey’s judiciary](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/02/15/turkeys-constitutional-court-has-been-rendered-irrelevant), including the constitutional court. The standoff over Mr Atalay will weaken it further.

### Guatemala gets a new president

Bernardo Arévalo will be sworn in as [Guatemala’s new president](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/01/11/guatemalas-new-president-promises-a-better-sort-of-government) on Sunday. The 65-year-old former diplomat has run a gauntlet to get there. After a surprise win in an election last year, a group of elites known as the “pact of the corrupt” tried to stop him from taking power. They insisted that ballots be reviewed, and tried to suspend his party, Semilla.

Widely regarded as competent and clean, Mr Arévalo offers Guatemalans hope for change. But bringing it about will be difficult. With only 23 of 160 seats in the congress, Semilla will have to find ways to convince lawmakers to support its plans—without offering the usual incentive of lucrative contracts. Attempts to undermine the president and his government are likely to continue. But Mr Arévalo has appointed a balanced cabinet, mixing politicians and technocrats. The country’s health care, education and infrastructure are in a dire state. Any improvement will be noticeable.

### Denmark’s king is crowned

On Sunday northern [Europe](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/22/translating-royal-names-is-a-relic-of-european-history) lost its last female monarch when Margrethe of Denmark stepped down after 52 years. Her son, Frederik, appeared on the balcony of Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen to be proclaimed king, before touring the capital in the royal coach to wave at his shivering subjects.

Margrethe’s abdication surprised many Danes—reportedly including Frederik, who was informed just a few days before it was announced. The state gives the monarch a monthly stipend of about $1m, including travel expenses and palace upkeep; the budget is set to rise. But that is hardly extravagant by [British standards](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/10/what-king-charles-could-mean-for-the-royal-finances) (the British royal family’s annual “sovereign grant” is nearly $110m). And 78% of Danes approve of the monarchy, up from 42% when Margrethe acceded. Before long, queens may be back in Europe: Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden is 77, and his heir is his daughter Victoria.

### Chasing records at the Australian Open

As he enters the 22nd year of his professional tennis career, Novak Djokovic has more records in his sights. He has already won more Grand Slam singles titles than any other man. But if he wins the [Australian Open](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/01/12/underpaid-and-overplayed-tennis-is-ripe-for-disruption), which begins on Sunday in Melbourne, he would surpass Margaret Court’s tally of 24 to become the most successful singles player of either gender. A sweep of all four Grand Slams in a calendar year would also remain in his grasp; no man has managed that in the Open era, which began in 1968. Standing in Mr Djokovic’s way will be his main rivals, Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz and Russia’s Daniil Medvedev, along with Italy’s fast-improving Jannik Sinner.

However, Mr Djokovic is unlikely to win the adulation of the Melbourne crowds. His refusal to abide by Australia’s covid protocols in 2022 caused a diplomatic incident and his [eventual deportation](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/01/14/australia-cancels-novak-djokovics-visa-again). When he returned last year, Mr Djokovic complained to umpires about his rough treatment from members of the crowd. Nonetheless, he still rallied to win the title.

### Weekend profile: Gabriel Attal, France’s new prime minister

If Gabriel Attal’s precocious political ascent feels familiar to the French, then that echo is the point. On January 9th Emmanuel Macron, who in 2017 seized the presidency aged 39, appointed the 34-year-old Mr Attal prime minister. He is [the youngest occupant](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/09/the-president-appoints-modern-frances-youngest-prime-minister) of the top government job in modern French history. For Mr Macron, the move marks a return to the original spirit of his centrist political project to, quite literally, modernise and rejuvenate France.

Raised in leafy Paris *quartiers*, Mr Attal grew up in an arty bourgeois family. His father, who died in 2015, was a film producer of Jewish-Tunisian origins; his mother, who has Russian-Orthodox roots, also works in film. Mr Attal enjoyed the best of the capital’s elite education (Ecole Alsacienne, Sciences-Po university, Assas law school). Unlike Mr Macron, however, Mr Attal is not a graduate of the technocratic Ecole Nationale d’Administration. Fans call him smart, hard-working, a fast learner and pragmatic; critics say he lacks a solid ideological underpinning and is untested as a top-level manager. Re-elected as a member of parliament in 2022, and already a two-time cabinet minister, Mr Attal first became a household name in France when he was appointed government spokesman in 2020. Punchy in television studios, but with a simple charm and linguistic clarity that sometimes eludes his boss, Mr Attal is a product of *la Macronie*: the group of young, mostly centre-left reformists who gravitated to Mr Macron before he won power. He even shares his boss’s taste for a dark narrow-legged suit.

To understand Mr Attal, says a colleague, you need to realise that “he was born to be a politician”. In an archive TV interview as a student, in which Mr Attal speaks with preternatural fluency, a fellow student quips “Gaby, president!…He’s the future!” No sooner had Mr Attal been appointed prime minister than he was off to northern France to console flood victims. The new prime minister also happens to be gay, and last year recounted how he had been bullied at school over his sexuality, before he was even sure of it himself. The risk for Mr Attal, who enjoys far better poll ratings than his boss, is that he has been over-promoted. The risk for Mr Macron is that his protégé outshines him.
