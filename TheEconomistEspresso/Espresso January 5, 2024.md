## The world in brief

### January 5, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Islamic State**, a Sunni jihadist terrorist group that once controlled swathes of Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for an attack in **Iran** on Wednesday that killed at least 84 people. IS has long targeted Iran, a predominantly Shia state. The two explosions took place in the southern city of Kerman during a ceremony to commemorate the anniversary of the death of Qassem Suleimani, an [Iranian general](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2020/01/09/obituary-qassem-suleimani-was-assassinated-on-january-3rd).

An American air strike in Baghdad killed the commander of an Iran-backed militia based in **Iraq**. In Lebanon **Hizbullah**, another [militia](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-hizbullah) supported by Iran, said that four of its members had been killed in an Israeli air strike near the [border with Israel](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/04/another-war-could-break-out-on-the-israel-lebanon-border). Tensions in the region have been escalating further after the killing of a senior **Hamas** official by drone in Beirut on Tuesday.

**Myanmar’s** junta announced it would free over 9,000 prisoners to mark the country’s Independence Day, though there was no indication that the figure would include any of the country’s 17,000 political prisoners. The country’s oppressive government has suffered a series of [astonishing military defeats](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/16/myanmars-junta-suffers-startling-defeats) since an offensive launched by a rebel coalition of ethnic armies last October.

Farmers in **Poland** resumed their blockade of the Medyka border crossing with **Ukraine**, having suspended the action over Christmas. Their aims include securing increased subsidies for corn, preventing tax hikes and banning some Ukrainian agricultural produce. The farmers will rejoin Polish truckers, who are protesting against what they see as [unfair competition](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/04/27/a-spat-over-farming-bodes-ill-for-ukraines-future-european-prospects) from their Ukrainian counterparts caused by EU rule changes following Russia’s invasion.

**Germany’s** annual inflation rate rose to 3.8% in December, up from 2.3% in November and its highest rate in three months. The increase, lower than expected, was driven by a reduction in subsidies for food and fuel. The rise might cause the European Central Bank to consider delaying interest-rate cuts, which some hoped would start as soon as March.

**CMOC group**, a Chinese mining company, became the world’s biggest cobalt producer, boosting its production by over 170% in 2023 to overtake Glencore, its Swiss-based rival. But [surging output](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/02/16/cobalt-a-crucial-battery-material-is-suddenly-superabundant) and falling demand for consumer electronics caused the price of the metal, which is important for making batteries, to tumble by 30% in 2023.

**Carrefour**, a supermarket giant, said it will stop selling products from **PepsiCo** due to “unacceptable price increases”. Shoppers in Belgium, France, Italy and Spain will have to go elsewhere for products such as Lipton Ice Tea, Quaker Oats and Doritos crisps. Food prices in France are estimated to have risen 7.1% in the 12 months to December.

### Russia intensifies its assault on Ukraine

Russia is stepping up its military operations in Ukraine. According to a senior Ukrainian general, there are twice as many battles as there were a few weeks ago. Russia continues to threaten in five main theatres across the east and south, though it is suffering significant losses and has yet to make a strategic breakthrough.

Russia has also switched [aerial tactics](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/29/russia-tries-to-overwhelm-ukraine-with-missiles); it is now attacking defence production rather than energy infrastructure. In early-morning barrages on December 29th and January 2nd Russia may have used nearly two months’ worth of its own missile output. Ukraine’s air defences intercepted at least 159 of them, though many got through, to devastating effect.

Ukraine is changing its tactics, too. On Tuesday an electricity substation in Moscow went up in flames, apparently because of a drone attack. Ukraine’s military intelligence released footage of a burning bomber plane in Chelyabinsk, more than 1,500km inside Russia. The news followed explosions in Belgorod, a Russian border city, and in Sevastopol, a port in occupied [Crimea](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/25/war-has-arrived-in-crimea).

### Hemedti’s momentum in Sudan

Sudan’s most notorious warlord, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (better known as Hemedti), is on a roll. In recent weeks his Rapid Support Forces have won a string of [victories](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/20/a-supposed-haven-in-sudan-falls-to-a-genocidal-militia) against the Sudanese army. After nine months of civil war Mr Dagalo appears to be on the verge of becoming [the outright winner](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/16/a-genocidal-militia-is-winning-the-war-in-sudan).

Sudan’s neighbours are starting to treat him like it. Since late December Mr Dagalo has been on a victory tour. Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Uganda have all rolled out the red carpet. On Tuesday the warlord signed an agreement to work with prominent Sudanese politicians, including a former prime minister. Next on the agenda might well be direct talks with General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan’s beleaguered army chief, which some hope will lead to a resolution of the conflict.

Do not expect such a summit to take place just yet, however. General Burhan is loth to be seen negotiating with the paramilitary leader. And Mr Dagalo senses total victory. He may prefer to make more military gains before talking.

### America’s healthy job market

Hopes for a soft landing in America will probably be supported by the country’s latest labour data. Figures published on Friday are expected to show that the economy added about 170,000 jobs in December. That would be high enough to signal that [economic growth](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/23/americas-astonishing-economic-growth-goes-up-another-gear) remained robust at the end of 2023 but low enough to suggest that the ultra-tight labour market of the past two years is easing. In a similar vein, the unemployment rate is forecast to have ticked up to about 3.8% in December.

Such gradual softening would probably help to slow the pace of wage increases and so alleviate inflationary pressures. That could give the Federal Reserve scope to trim interest rates, without having to wait for a recession to strike. But the path ahead looks bumpy. Until the Fed is more confident that inflation is [truly under control](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/03/has-america-really-escaped-inflation), it will refrain from cutting rates.

### The euro-zone’s volatile inflation

Having fallen for months, euro-zone inflation is in for some volatility. France released its provisional December figures on Wednesday. The harmonised index of consumer prices rose by 4.1% year on year (from 3.9% in November) owing to an increase in energy costs. December’s consumer-price figures for the whole bloc, released on Friday, will probably also show a rise in the annual inflation rate. That could spook investors, who may fear that the [European Central Bank](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/13/has-the-european-central-bank-become-too-powerful) will [delay](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/13/the-fed-gives-in-to-the-clamour-for-looser-money) interest-rate cuts.

But the numbers may be better news than they first appear to be. Germany’s headline annual inflation rate increased, from 2.3% in November to 3.8% in December. Yet the core rate, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, fell. The core rate is also falling in Spain, while the headline annual rate is stuck at around 3%. Today’s euro-zone data may show a rise from the 2.4% rate in November. But the downward trend will probably continue.

### An arts fest in Sydney

Every January millions of Australians leave their homes for long holidays on farflung beaches. Sydney Festival, a three-week arts extravaganza that begins on Friday, was conceived to encourage residents of the second-biggest city to stay put.

The festival, which has run for almost half a century, drew more than 420,000 people last year with a vast programme of concerts, theatre and art. This year the theme is water. More than 130 events will take place around the city’s harbour. Some will happen on the water itself.

A performance of *Il Tabarro,* a one-act opera by Giacomo Puccini, will be staged on an old ship. A wharf at Walsh Bay will host a “festival takeover” consisting of late-night music and sunrise yoga. And festival-goers can choose from a host of performances by indigenous artists, including a theatrical tribute to Warumpi Band, a pioneering Aboriginal rock group. That should give Sydneysiders plenty of reasons to stay in town.
