## The world in brief

### December 5, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Binyamin Netanyahu**’s corruption trial resumed on Monday, after a suspension expired that had halted work at Israel’s courts following Hamas’s attack on October 7th. The [embattled](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/29/how-america-should-manage-the-next-stage-of-the-gaza-war) Israeli prime minister is accused of bribery and fraud, among other charges; he denies wrongdoing. Meanwhile **Israel** told residents in parts of **Khan Younis**, a city in [southern Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/26/a-brutal-battle-for-southern-gaza-beckons-after-the-truce-ends), to evacuate. The city has become the focus of Israel’s ground operations, which, it said on Sunday, were expanding to all areas of the enclave. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said that more than 15,500 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7th.

**Venezuela’s** government claimed that citizens [voted](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/12/04/venezuelas-autocrat-nicolas-maduro-threatens-to-annex-guyana) in favour of claiming sovereignty over Essequibo, an oil-rich region which makes up two-thirds of the territory of neighbouring [Guyana](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/03/26/guyanas-tiny-population-braces-for-a-gusher-of-petrodollars). It said that 10.5m voters, of more than 20m eligible, voted in a referendum on Sunday—though few were reported to be seen at polling centres. The region’s borders have been contested since they were drawn in the nineteenth century.

Federal prosecutors in **Miami** accused a retired American diplomat of spying for **Cuba**. Manuel Rocha, who was once ambassador to Bolivia, was charged with illegally acting as a foreign agent, among other crimes. Authorities allege that Mr Rocha fed “false and misleading information” to the government and met with Cuban agents in Havana as late as 2017. He has not yet commented.

Thousands of people were evacuated and several died as Cyclone Michaung battered **India’s** southern coast with torrential rain and strong winds. In the coastal city of Chennai, an electronics manufacturing hub, severe flooding closed several factories as well as the airport, one of the busiest in India. The storm is expected to continue moving through the country on Tuesday.

The price of **gold** surged to a record high, as traders increase their bets that America’s Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates. The [precious metal’s](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/13/the-mystery-of-gold-prices) price reached $2,135 per ounce, above its previous peak of $2,075, set in August 2020. **Bitcoin** also reached a 20-month high, helped by optimism regulators will approve stockmarket funds for the virtual currency.

**Spotify** announced plans to cut almost one fifth of its workforce, around 1,500 people, in the music-streaming giant’s third round of layoffs this year. The company has so far avoided the subscriber slowdown that has hit video streaming companies. But its boss, Daniel Ek, said that Spotify needed to become more efficient in the face of challenges such as higher capital costs.

**Bears** have injured or killed 212 people in **Japan** since April, a record number of attacks. The increase in incidents is probably caused by bears wandering closer to human settlements as they struggle to find food; this year has had a poor crop of bear staples, such as beech nuts. Some hungry bears may also delay hibernation, leaving more time to run into humans.

### COP28 knuckles down

During the opening days of COP28, the United Nations’ climate summit in the oil-rich [United Arab Emirates](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/23/the-messier-the-world-gets-the-more-the-uae-seems-to-thrive), delegates were treated to promises—and controversies. Commitments include a global [“loss and damage”](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/11/20/a-new-un-fund-for-loss-and-damage-emerges-from-cop27) fund; $30bn in climate finance from the UAE; a pledge to triple renewable energy by 2030 (from 2020 levels); and a commitment by 50 oil-and-gas companies to make their carbon emissions [net zero](https://www.economist.com/films/2021/07/30/what-is-net-zero) by 2050.

The hosts hope these will distract from leaks suggesting that they hoped to use the summit to strike fossil-fuel deals and from comments by [Sultan Al Jaber](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/16/three-climate-fights-will-dominate-cop28), the president of COP, which questioned the science behind the claim that phasing out fossil fuels is needed to lessen climate change.

Now that most world leaders have left Dubai, the harder and more important work of the conference begins. National negotiators must plough through reams of documents collated for a “global stocktake”, the first on countries’ climate progress since 2015. They must then translate that into an agreement on the next steps. Expect more controversy.

### The impact of school closures revealed

More than three and a half years after governments began [closing classrooms](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/06/24/closing-the-worlds-schools-caused-children-great-harm), analysts are still figuring out how the covid-19 pandemic has affected [pupils’ progress](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/07/07/covid-learning-loss-has-been-a-global-disaster). Data to be released on Tuesday by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, will offer the best snapshot yet of how the impact on learning compares in countries across the developed world.

For two decades the organisation has asked children in multiple countries (now 81) to sit identical tests of reading, maths and science, as part of a programme known as PISA. Its most recent round of assessments, carried out between March and November 2022, was the first since 2018. Even before shutdowns marks from schools in the rich world were trending downwards. The cause is not clear, but no-one thinks the pandemic improved things. Parents and policymakers will scour the results to see which countries did the best job of protecting learning during the pandemic—and whose pupils have fallen furthest behind.

### Dutch coalition negotiations

The anti-Muslim, anti-EU populist [Geert Wilders](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/24/who-is-geert-wilders-the-surprise-winner-of-the-dutch-election) and his Party For Freedom (PVV) came first in the Dutch election on November 22nd. Since then Ronald Plasterk, the *verkenner* (scout) in the [coalition negotiations](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/30/geert-wilders-struggles-towards-power-in-the-netherlands), has been sounding out other parties about forming a government with the long-shunned PVV. It is not going smoothly.

The second-biggest ring-wing party, the centre-right Liberals, will not enter a coalition government led by the PVV but might back one on certain issues. Pieter Omtzigt, whose brand-new New Social Contract finished fourth, says Mr Wilders must guarantee freedom of religion and commit to staying in the EU before he will talk.

On Tuesday Mr Plasterk will speak to the Liberals and the Farmer Citizen Movement, a smaller party not expected to play much of a role. Early next week he will issue a report, and then parliament will appoint mediators between the PVV and willing parties—if there are any. They may be reluctant to form a government with Mr Wilders, but they are wary of being seen to torpedo one.

### South Africa flirts with recession

The African National Congress, which has ruled South Africa for almost 30 years, has a problem managing party finances. On Monday court officials catalogued assets to be seized from the ANC’s headquarters to repay a debt of 102m rand ($5.4m) owed to a printing company which worked on an election campaign in 2019.

The ANC has done little better managing Africa’s biggest industrial economy. A report on third-quarter GDP, due out on Tuesday, is expected to show that growth slowed to 0.1-0.2%, from 0.6% in the three months to the end of June. Mining and manufacturing were dragged down by power cuts and failing railways.

The weak economy will not help the campaign of Cyril Ramaphosa, the leader of the ANC, to be re-elected as president of South Africa next year. Polls suggest that support for the ANC will fall below 50% for the first time since the end of white minority rule in 1994. Such a result would probably force the ANC to form a coalition government with opposition parties. After decades of incompetence and corruption voters are looking for change.

### A political Turner prize

The Turner prize, Britain’s most prestigious for visual arts, was first awarded in 1984. One critic, shocked by the contemporary works, lamented that the 19th-century Romantic painter it was named after “must be rotating in his grave”. But the prize, which will be awarded again on Tuesday, reflects British art, and society itself.

In the 1990s rock-star artists like Damien Hirst won Turners. But recent prizes have gone to more collaborative creators. [In 2019](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/12/04/turner-prizes-for-all) four Turner nominees asked that the £40,000 ($50,000) prize be divided among them as an act of political “solidarity”. [In 2021](https://www.economist.com/culture/2021/12/02/array-collective-a-group-from-belfast-wins-the-turner-prize) only collectives were nominated.

In a reflection of how Britain is reckoning with [the legacy of colonialism](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/09/16/the-british-empire-peaked-100-years-ago-this-month), Barbara Walker is this year’s favourite on a shortlist of four. Her portraits of Caribbean [migrants](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2018/06/12/portraits-of-the-windrush-generation) affected by the [Windrush scandal](https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/04/18/the-national-shame-of-britains-treatment-of-windrush-migrants), some on copies of the legal documents that attest to their right to remain in Britain, are a haunting response to [a shameful episode](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/05/05/britain-needs-a-national-identity-register).
