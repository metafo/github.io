## The world in brief

### October 2, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Matt Gaetz, a **Republican** congressman from Florida, said he would move to oust Kevin McCarthy, the beleaguered speaker of the **House of Representatives**, for working with Democrats to pass an 11th-hour stopgap funding bill. President Joe Biden signed the bill, which prevented a government [shutdown](https://web.archive.org/web/20231001145118/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/28/americas-next-government-shutdown-could-be-the-strangest-yet) in America, late on Saturday. The bill provides money for disaster relief, but none of the aid for Ukraine that Democrats had sought. The scrambling follows weeks during which hard-right Republican congressmen, seeking swingeing spending cuts, had blocked efforts to fund the government.

**Turkey’s** government said **terrorists** detonated an explosive outside a government building in the capital, Ankara, close to the parliament where Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, was due to speak. One bomber died in the blast; police shot a second. It is not clear who was behind the violence. Kurdish militants and Islamic State have carried out attacks in Turkey in the past.

**Smer**, a pro-Russian party led by Robert Fico, a former prime minister, won **Slovakia’s election**. With almost all ballots counted, Smer took 24% of the vote. Earlier, exit polls suggested Progressive Slovakia, a liberal party, had won the election, but it took around 17% of the vote. Smer will now probably attempt to form a coalition with other, smaller parties.

The first **UN** humanitarian mission in 30 years arrived in **Nagorno-Karabakh** at the invitation of Azerbaijan’s government**.** The organisation had no access to the enclave while it was controlled by Armenian separatists, who were ousted by Azerbaijan last week.. Armenia’s government has said that the vast majority of Nagorno-Karabakh’s ethnic Armenians have [fled to the country](https://web.archive.org/web/20231001145118/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/a-humanitarian-disaster-is-under-way-in-nagorno-karabakh) from the enclave.

Mohamed Muizzu, a pro-China opposition leader, defeated Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, the incumbent, in a presidential election in the **Maldives**. After coming to power in 2018, [Mr Solih](https://web.archive.org/web/20231001145118/https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/09/24/an-election-upset-in-the-maldives) strengthened the Maldives’ ties with India while distancing the country from Chinese investors. Mr Muizzu, the mayor of Male, the country’s capital, has vowed to limit India’s influence in the Maldives.

**Ukraine** hosted an international defence industry conference in an attempt to bolster local weapons production for its [counter-offensive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231001145118/https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2023-09-23) against Russia. Speaking at the forum in Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelensky, the president, said that he aims to make Ukraine a “large military hub”, prioritising air defence and de-mining technologies. Around 250 weapons producers from 30 countries attended.

“No one is safe” from **bedbugs** in Paris, said **France’s government**. Clément Beaune, the transport minister, said the government would act to “reassure and protect” Parisians from a widespread infestation of the blood-sucking pests. The highly mobile bugs have been spotted on various forms of public transport. Emmanuel Grégoire, the deputy mayor, warned that previous campaigns against bedbugs had failed to prevent them from breaching the centre of the capital.

### Trump back in court

On Monday Donald Trump will stand trial in state civil court in New York, accused of misreporting property values to secure better loan terms from lenders. Last week the presiding judge agreed with prosecutors’ central allegation: Mr Trump, he ruled, had indeed [committed fraud](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/27/donald-trump-is-found-liable-for-fraud-in-his-real-estate-dealings). Now the judge will take up the rest of the alleged offences—that business records were falsified, among others—and decide penalties. Letitia James, New York’s attorney-general, wants to fine Mr Trump $250m and bar him from serving as a corporate director in the state.

Yet Ms James has already won big. Last week the judge cancelled Mr Trump’s business licences, which allow the Trump Organisation to operate in New York, and ordered a receiver to oversee them for now. Eventually his assets in New York may have to be sold. Mr Trump denies the allegations and has promised to appeal against last week’s ruling. With good reason: the punishment is sometimes called a corporate death penalty.

### Turkey’s fickle position on Sweden’s NATO accession

NATO officials and Swedish diplomats will be watching nervously as Turkey’s parliament reopens this week, following [general elections](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/28/recep-tayyip-erdogan-is-re-elected-as-turkeys-president) in May and the summer recess. Sweden’s accession to the alliance was assumed to be a done deal when, in July, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, dropped his objections to the country’s membership ahead of a NATO summit in Vilnius.

But the Turkish strongman, who has repeatedly accused Sweden of harbouring supporters of the PKK, an armed Kurdish separatist group, has again slammed on the brakes. Mr Erdogan says that parliament, where his coalition enjoys a comfortable majority, is not ready to ratify Sweden’s accession protocols. (Hungary’s president, Viktor Orban, the other holdout, said he is in no hurry to ratify either.) Turkey will go ahead with ratification, he said on September 26th, only if America’s Congress [approves](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/08/president-erdogan-wants-to-make-nice-with-the-west-on-his-terms) the sale of F-16 warplanes to his country. A former footballer, Mr Erdogan certainly knows how to keep moving the goalposts.

### America’s justices return to the bench

On Monday the Supreme Court embarks on another big term. Blockbuster cases will include one on the constitutionality of a firearms ban for domestic abusers under restraining orders. But a less eye-catching series of cases concerning [administrative agencies](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/28/the-new-supreme-court-term-takes-aim-at-the-administrative-state) could transform the way the federal government works—and tilt the balance of power from the executive branch to the judiciary.

The fate of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—[established](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2017/11/30/the-cfpb-born-in-controversy-becomes-a-farce) to shield consumers from fraud after the global financial crisis of 2007-09—comes into the justices’ hands on Tuesday. Later in the autumn, the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose mission is to protect investors and regulate markets, faces a reckoning. A third case is likely to bury a nearly 40-year-old precedent deferring to agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous laws.

Another quandary ahead is whether an involuntary internal job transfer motivated by gender bias violates the Civil Rights Act’s ban on workplace discrimination. A challenge to abortion pills looms, too.

### Brazil’s changing economy

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s [leftist president](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/09/19/how-left-wing-on-economics-is-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva), has promised a new “industrial revolution”. The purchasing managers’ index, released on Monday, may show manufacturers’ sentiment improving. PMI was slightly above neutral in August, the first time it had signalled growth in ten months. But despite Lula’s enthusiasm, manufacturing is becoming less important. Today it accounts for just 10% of GDP, down from a third in the 1980s, when the president was a trade-union leader.

On Monday Brazil will also publish balance-of-trade data for September. It recorded a surplus of $9.7bn in August, thanks to strong Chinese demand for commodities. China also bought much of Brazil’s record grain harvest, which boosted GDP in the first quarter, and [agribusiness](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/09/21/brazils-hinterland-now-resembles-texas) was strong in the second too. Lula once called farmers “fascists”. But now he is reaping the fruits of their labour. In June 24% of Brazilians were pessimistic about the economy; in September, just 18% were.

### Hollywood strikes reach their final act

Dust-sheets cover the sets inside Hollywood studios. They have been on since May, when America’s writers downed pens. In July the country’s actors joined them on strike. But on September 24th the Writers Guild of America said they had reached a tentative deal with the studios. Its members will vote on that this week. The stage is now set for the [actors to do the same](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/25/hollywoods-strike-enters-its-final-act-as-writers-reach-a-deal), as their union, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, return to the negotiating table on Monday.

SAG-AFTRA represents actors, broadcast journalists and voiceover artists. It is demanding a revenue-sharing deal with the streamers, plus an 11% rise in basic wages, which the studios have rejected. A few more weeks of negotiation look likely, with a deal possible in late November. With the industry on hold for nearly half the year, time is running out to save next year’s summer blockbusters.
