Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

A second aid convoy entered **Gaza** from Egypt, the UN confirmed. The 14 lorries—carrying “only water, food and medical equipment”, according to the **Israeli** defence ministry—follow 20 that entered the besieged enclave on Saturday. Earlier Binyamin Netanyahu warned Hizbullah against opening up a [new front](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/22/israels-window-of-legitimacy-in-gaza-is-shrinking) against Israel. Mr Netnyahu, Israel’s prime minister, told Israeli soldiers his country would strike the Iran-backed Shia militia based in Lebanon with “a force it cannot even imagine”. Israel repeated a call for people in the northern part of Gaza to move south.

**The Philippines** accused **China** of “provocative, irresponsible and illegal action” after a Chinese vessel collided with a Philippine resupply boat in the South China Sea. China’s coast guard said it “lawfully” blocked the Philippine vessel, which was carrying “illegal construction materials” to a warship. Such clashes have become increasingly common amid Chinese [expansionism in the South China Sea](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/21/chinas-claim-to-the-south-china-sea-gets-even-odder).

**Argentines** voted in a general election. The country’s economic crisis, with annual inflation running at 138%, has contributed to the rise of an outsider candidate to the top of the opinion polls. [Javier Milei](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/09/07/meet-javier-milei-the-frontrunner-to-be-argentinas-next-president) is a right-wing libertarian economist who wants to slash public spending and adopt the US dollar as the national currency.

Iran’s state media said that the country will host a conference on Monday to discuss the [conflict](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/a-humanitarian-disaster-is-under-way-in-nagorno-karabakh) between **Armenia** and **Azerbaijan** over the ethnic-Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. The foreign ministers of Russia, Turkey and Georgia are due to attend, together with their counterparts from the two warring South Caucasus countries. Iran said the meeting would thus happen without the “interference of Western countries.”

An **Iranian** teenage girl who fell into a coma after an alleged encounter with the morality police was declared “brain dead”. Activists accuse the police of attacking her in the Tehran metro for not wearing a hijab; the government argues that she merely fainted. Comparisons have been made to [Mahsa Amini](https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/09/28/im-the-same-as-mahsa-and-i-want-my-freedom-anger-at-irans-regime-spills-onto-the-streets), who died in police custody last year, sparking nationwide protests.

**Slovenia** deployed police to its borders with **Croatia** and **Hungary**, citing security threats from “members of various terrorist and extremist groups”. On Friday the Slovenian government had introduced temporary border controls at crossings, following a similar move by neighbouring Italy. European officials are increasingly concerned about the fallout from the Israel-Hamas war.

**Sir Bobby Charlton**, lauded by many as England’s finest ever footballer, died at the age of 86. The highlight of an international career that saw him play 106 times for his country was a starring role in England’s sole World Cup victory in 1966. A dynamic midfielder, Sir Bobby played more than 750 times for Manchester United, winning the European Cup and three league titles.

### Australia and America snuggle up

Australia’s centre-left prime minister, Anthony Albanese, flies to America on Monday for meetings with President Joe Biden. Australia has relied on its mate for security since Japanese troops swept towards it in the second world war. Concerns about China are now[ nudging the two nations even closer](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/23/australia-is-becoming-americas-military-launch-pad-into-asia). “The United States has no closer ally than Australia,” declared Mr Biden in 2021.

The clearest example of that is AUKUS, a defence agreement (including Britain) that will arm Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. Australia is also upgrading military bases to host more American forces and [beefing up its defences](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/04/25/fearing-china-australia-rethinks-its-defence-strategy) more generally. The two leaders will discuss plans to secure supplies of [critical minerals](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/20/can-australia-break-chinas-monopoly-on-critical-minerals).

Australians generally support the American alliance and AUKUS, but recoil at the idea of sending troops in the case of a war over Taiwan. With that in mind, Mr Albanese has tried to at least stabilise relations with China. He will visit Xi Jinping in Beijing in November. It will be the first trip there by an Australian prime minister since 2016.

### The Israel Defence Forces on pause

For over a week Israeli ground forces have been at peak combat-readiness in their staging areas, ready to go into Gaza. And yet, while the stated aim of the Israeli government, in the wake of the Hamas [attack ](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/08/the-lessons-from-hamass-assault-on-israel)on October 7th, is to destroy the Islamist movement’s military capabilities and its government in Gaza, the order for the operation has yet to come from the war cabinet.

There are several reasons for the [delay](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/as-israels-invasion-of-gaza-nears-the-obstacles-get-more-daunting). First, an international effort is finally under way to get as many Gazan civilians out of harm’s way and provide basic supplies before an Israeli invasion. Second, the hope remains that some of the 210 hostages abducted by Hamas to Gaza can be released before the full might of the army is unleashed. But there is also concern over the prospect of a second front opening up with Hizbullah on Israel’s northern border and the hesitation of the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to commit to a full-scale war. Meanwhile the soldiers sit on their kit and wait.

### Singapore’s economy picks up

[Singapore](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/11/a-winner-has-emerged-in-the-old-rivalry-between-singapore-and-hong-kong) is set to release rosy inflation figures for the second month in a row on Monday, while the economy grew faster than anticipated in the third quarter of this year. GDP increased by 1% from July to September, up from 0.1% growth in the preceding quarter. Core annual inflation eased to 3.4% in August, from a high of 5.5% in January.

Yet the country’s central bank expects “muted” growth in the city-state. Israel’s war with Hamas risks driving oil prices higher. That would push up energy costs and inflation for Singaporeans, at a time when they face price hikes from public transport and utilities such as water.

In August, a survey of professional forecasters carried out by the central bank named a global economic slowdown, inflationary pressures and China’s [slowing growth](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/17/chinas-slowing-economy-seen-from-ground-level) as the biggest risks to Singapore’s economy. The bank says it will increase the frequency of monetary-policy statements from a half-yearly schedule to a quarterly basis. That may be a wise precaution as the global economy becomes more volatile.

### Co-defendants turn on Trump

Fani Willis—the prosecutor in Fulton County, Georgia, who brought [sweeping charges](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/15/donald-trumps-racketeering-indictment-is-the-most-sweeping-yet) against Donald Trump and 18 others for allegedly plotting to reverse the results of the 2020 presidential election—has a well-worn strategy. She has brought at least 11 RICO cases, which [corral multiple defendants](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/08/15/why-was-rico-a-mafia-targeting-act-used-to-charge-donald-trump) accused of participating in a criminal scheme. Smaller-fry targets can hope to secure plea agreements.

Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro, two such defendants and both former lawyers for Mr Trump, were due to start their trials on Monday. Instead, they will receive probation after admitting to lesser offences in exchange for co-operating with prosecutors. Ms Powell, however, might not make a great witness against Mr Trump, who denies wrongdoing: she once promised, in attempting to prove voter fraud, to “release the Kraken”, referring to the mythical sea monster. But she and Mr Cheseboro do have to hand over documents to help Ms Willis’s case. Mr Trump’s lawyers will [stay busy](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/06/a-primer-on-trumps-criminal-trials) in the meantime; on Monday, in New York, they will appeal against a decision to hold him liable in a defamation case.

### The Pergamon’s lengthy refurbishment

In recent months crowds have flocked to the Pergamon Museum in Berlin to get a final glimpse before it closes for refurbishment on Monday. The project is part of an overhaul of [Museum Island](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/07/12/berlins-museum-island-gets-a-much-needed-revamp), Germany’s most popular cultural complex. Modernisation of the Pergamon began ten years ago, with the closure of its north wing, which houses the [Pergamon altar](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/12/15/a-workshop-in-berlin-offers-masterpieces-to-the-world), a Hellenistic structure from the second century BC that looks more like a temple. Now the south wing is closed, too, for the building of an extension due to be finished in 2037.

Some of the Pergamon’s artefacts will be displayed in other museums in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. If everything goes according to plan, the altar will be viewable again within three years in the Pergamon’s north wing, in a light-filled new gallery. But the vividly blue Ishtar gate, a masterpiece from Babylon, will remain behind closed doors for 14 years. Berliners and tourists alike will have to be very patient.
