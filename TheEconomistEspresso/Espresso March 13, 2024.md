Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Kenya** will not deploy police officers to Haiti until a new government is formed there, according to Kenyan officials. The decision came after Ariel Henry, **Haiti’s** [embattled prime minister](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/03/07/the-last-scraps-of-the-haitian-state-are-evaporating), resigned following talks with regional leaders in Jamaica. Mr Henry had been in Kenya to finalise an agreement to send 1,000 officers to Haiti, when gangs overran Port-au-Prince, the capital.

**America’s** [consumer prices](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/02/16/american-consumers-are-finally-cheering-up) rose by 3.2% in the year to February, up from 3.1% in January. Core prices—which exclude energy and food—increased by 0.4% month on month in February, the second consecutive month the figure has exceeded expectations. The data will inform rate-setters at the Federal Reserve, due to meet next week.

David Cameron, **Britain’s** foreign secretary, called for “answers from the Israelis” after the BBC reported that Palestinian medics, detained during a raid on Nasser hospital in **Gaza**, had allegedly been abused by Israeli soldiers. Three medics told the broadcaster that they had been beaten, doused in water and made to kneel for hours. The Israel Defence Forces said it prohibits abuse of detainees.

**America** will send a weapons package worth $300m to **Ukraine**, cobbled together from savings in defence contracts—a measure that Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said was “nowhere near enough” to meet the country’s needs. The president has authority to send emergency military assistance, but funds to replenish American weapons are overdrawn. A package including $60bn for Ukraine is [stalled in Congress](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/14/house-republicans-fear-trump-too-much-to-aid-ukraine).

**Klaus Iohannis**, Romania’s president, entered the race to succeed Jens Stoltenberg as secretary-general of **NATO**. Mr Iohannis will challenge Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, who has struggled to gain support from all 32 of the alliance’s members. America, Britain, France and Germany favour Mr Rutte. But as Russia’s war with Ukraine continues, Mr Iohannis’s emphasis on [eastern Europe’s “valuable contribution” to NATO](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/10/as-donald-trump-threatens-nato-the-baltic-states-stiffen-their-defences) could strike a chord.

The governor of the **Bank of Japan**, [Ueda Kazuo](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/02/14/the-bank-of-japans-new-governor-ueda-kazuo-marks-a-break-with-tradition), said that the Japanese economy is recovering despite some difficulties. He cited a “weakness in some household spending data” but noted that business investment is increasing steadily. Traders widely interpreted Mr Ueda’s remarks as offering a marginally less positive view of Japan’s economy than expected, leading the yen to fall slightly.

A **Romanian** court approved a request by **Britain** to extradite [Andrew Tate](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/12/30/who-is-andrew-tate-the-misogynist-hero-to-millions-of-young-men), a misogynistic influencer, and his brother to the country, after their trial in Romania ends. They were detained in Romania after a British court issued a warrant for their arrest over alleged sexual crimes. The pair face charges of human trafficking and rape in Romania. They deny all charges.

### TikTok v Congress

Last week a stern pop-up message interrupted American TikTokers’ [scrolling](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/25/the-rise-of-the-tiktok-news-anchor). “Congress is planning a total ban” of the short-video app, it warned users, urging them to call their representative to protect their “Constitutional right to free expression”. On Wednesday the House of Representatives appears poised to pass the bill in question, which is less a “total ban” (such efforts have faced legal challenges) than a requirement that TikTok be separated from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.

Lawmakers have [long fretted](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/23/america-may-be-a-step-closer-to-banning-tiktok) about the national-security threats TikTok may pose: both the data that the company may be collecting, and the potential for the app to spread propaganda on behalf of China’s government. It is already barred on government devices.

President Joe Biden supports the new bill, though the Senate is divided. TikTok fans have reportedly flooded lawmakers’ phone lines, emphasising how much time they spend on the app—which only emboldened those critics who believe Americans are being brainwashed.

### Britain’s underperforming economy

On Wednesday Britain’s statistics office will release GDP data for January. The update is the first since the news that a 0.1% month-on-month contraction in December pushed the economy into a technical recession. It has barely grown since the pandemic, and has performed less well than the euro zone and America. Economists think Britain resumed growing in January, but by a modest 0.2%.

Data released Tuesday showed that the [unemployment rate](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/14/why-are-so-many-britons-not-working) ticked up to 3.9% (from 3.8%) and that wage growth fell faster than expected. Inflation numbers are due next Wednesday. All this will guide the rate-setters at the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, which is due to meet next week. The MPC’s last vote was an unusual [three-way split](https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/02/08/britains-economy-will-need-rate-cuts-sooner-rather-than-later): members voted to raise rates, to lower them and to keep them steady. This division reflects economic trends that are in tension with each other: reasonably robust employment, falling (but still high) inflation and feeble growth.

### Germany’s missile saga continues

Germany’s [Taurus cruise missiles](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/06/the-damage-done-by-russias-hack-of-germanys-defence-ministry) boast exceptional accuracy, explosive force and range. They also pack the power to cause controversy. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, has for months dodged calls from allies abroad and political foes at home to deliver the weapons to Ukraine. But the issue always resurfaces. On Wednesday he faces a grilling in Germany’s parliament and on Thursday the opposition will table a motion to deliver Taurus.

That vote will probably not succeed, but nor will the missile saga end. Most Germans agree with Mr Scholz that, as Ukraine’s second-biggest donor of military and financial aid after America, Germany is doing enough. But hawks say that “enough” would be giving Ukraine the means to beat Russia. The Taurus, a better version of systems France and Britain have already sent, would give Ukraine’s beleaguered armed forces a welcome boost. The day may yet come when Mr Scholz sees the need for the missiles to stop flying in circles and instead land with a bang.

### High hopes for a fashion giant

The world’s biggest fashion retailer, [Inditex](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/01/16/how-inditex-is-refashioning-its-business-model), publishes its earnings on Wednesday. The Spanish group—which owns both high-street brands (Zara) and upmarket ones (Massimo Dutti)—has been on a tear recently. Net profit reached €4.1bn ($4.4bn) in the nine months to October last year, an increase of nearly a third over the same period in 2022. Inditex has been gradually raising prices while keeping inventory low, getting garments from design to shelves in as little as a fortnight.

Not everything, however, has been going well. In December Zara caused uproars with adverts that seemed to show a mannequin in a white body bag amid rubble. Zara said that the pictures were misunderstood and were taken before Israel’s offensive in Gaza. But it withdrew them anyway. The misstep doesn’t seem to have hurt Inditex’s share price, however. And on March 8th Ukraine’s foreign ministry praised the firm for deciding to reopen most of the 84 stores it had closed following Russia’s invasion.

### Monet’s garden blooms again

It is surely the most famous garden in art history. [Claude Monet](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/23/claude-monet-is-celebrated-in-a-colourful-new-biography) called the grounds of his house in Giverny, just west of Paris, his “most beautiful masterpiece”. It was there that he produced his most celebrated series, “Water Lilies” (made up of 250 paintings), as well as renditions of irises and wisteria. Almost a century after Monet’s death in 1926, half a million people visit Giverny every year.

A new exhibition at the Garden Museum in London shows how Monet turned the garden into a profusion of flowers and trees. After his son’s death, however, Giverny fell into disrepair. Jean-Marie Toulgouat—who grew up in the village and was the great-grandson of Monet’s second wife—worked as an adviser on its restoration ahead of the reopening in 1980. Mr Toulgouat painted pictures of the garden at the same time. On display in London are his abstract renderings of dahlias, tulips and nasturtiums in bold strokes of colour. Some landscapes, it seems, demand a canvas.
