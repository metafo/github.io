## The world in brief

### January 10, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



Antony Blinken, **America’s** secretary of state, urged **Israel** to seek a “practical pathway” to a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza is over. In meetings with Israel’s prime minister, **Binyamin Netanyahu**, and other officials, Mr Blinken emphasised the need to plan for a long-term solution to the conflict. He also urged Israel to do more to avoid civilian casualties in [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas) and pushed for further aid to be allowed into the territory. Meanwhile Hizbullah, a Lebanese militant group, launched drone strikes against an Israeli command post.

Armed men broke into a state-owned TV studio and interrupted a live broadcast in **Ecuador**, prompting Daniel Noboa, the president, to recognise an “internal armed conflict”. It is the latest incident in a wave of violence that has terrorised the country since Sunday, after the leader of the Los Choneros gang apparently escaped from prison. On Monday Mr Noboa declared a state of emergency.

Emmanuel Macron, **France’s** president, [appointed](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/09/the-president-appoints-modern-frances-youngest-prime-minister) **Gabriel Attal** as his prime minister. He succeeds Elisabeth Borne, who resigned from the position on Monday. The 34-year old is an ally of Mr Macron, who hopes to revive his party’s waning fortunes ahead of the European elections in June. Mr Attal will be France’s first openly gay prime minister, as well as its youngest.

**Lloyd Austin**, America’s defence secretary, has been in hospital from complications resulting from prostate-cancer treatment, a diagnosis that Joe Biden apparently only learned of on Tuesday. The Pentagon’s disclosure came after days of questions about Mr Austin’s [mysterious medical absence](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/08/joe-bidens-disappearing-defence-secretary). Mr Austin went under general anaesthesia (also without notifying the White House) to undergo “minimally invasive” surgery in December, then contracted an infection.

The **World Bank** published forecasts predicting the past half-decade will have seen the worst economic growth in 30 years. Based on its projections, the organisation suggested that gross domestic product around the world will expand by just 2.4% this year. The bank also predicts a slowdown in trade growth due to higher interest rates and an increase in conflict.

Lawmakers in **Norway** gave approval for [deep-sea mining](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/07/02/deep-sea-mining-may-soon-ease-the-worlds-battery-metal-shortage) to be carried out in the country’s Arctic waters. The measure could make huge reserves of zinc and cobalt available to miners, according to a government paper released last year. Interest in deep-sea mining has boomed in recent years due to growing demand for minerals, despite opposition from environmental groups.

**NASA** delayed its upcoming Artemis II mission, the first American project to [send people near the Moon](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/astronauts-are-returning-to-the-moonwell-sort-of) since 1972, which had been scheduled for this year. It will now wait until 2025. The next mission, landing two astronauts on the Moon’s south pole, was also put off. Earlier Astrobotic Technology [abandoned plans](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/01/09/an-american-rocket-has-a-fine-debut-not-so-the-moon-lander-on-board) to land its already-launched Peregrine spacecraft on the Moon.

### Indonesia and the Philippines can learn from each other

Ferdinand Marcos, the Philippines president, and Joko Widodo, his Indonesian counterpart, known as Jokowi, will meet in Manila on Wednesday to discuss ways to strengthen links between their countries. They have much in common: together they form one archipelago, which fringes Southeast Asia; they are the most populous countries in the region; and both are democracies.

They also have adversaries in common. Islamist jihadists once caused great trouble on both sides of the border. Though now a largely latent threat, they do occasionally resurface: a bomb planted by followers of Islamic State killed four Christian worshippers in the Philippines on December 3rd. Another common danger is China, which covets some parts of the [South China Sea](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/21/chinas-claim-to-the-south-china-sea-gets-even-odder) where, under international law, the Philippines and Indonesia have exclusive rights to oil, gas and fish. Jokowi could learn from Mr Marcos’s strategy in the unarmed marine conflict; Mr Marcos could learn from Jokowi’s strategy for suppressing jihadists.

### France’s new prime minister

A reshuffle of the French government is expected soon, after the unexpected nomination of its new and startlingly young head. [Gabriel Attal](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/09/the-president-appoints-modern-frances-youngest-prime-minister), the 34-year-old former education minister, was appointed prime minister on January 9th by Emmanuel Macron. An early recruit to the president’s centrist movement, Mr Attal is the youngest prime minister in modern France, nominated by its youngest president.

Mr Macron must hope that Mr Attal—popular on both the left and the right—can help reset his troubled second term. Mr Attal has promised to “devote every second”, and will soon unveil his reform agenda. But his appointment is also an attempt to boost Mr Macron’s centrist party’s chances at European Parliament elections in June. Polls give a big lead to the National Rally party, led by the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, to which Marine Le Pen belongs. The campaign may become a duel between the two young leaders, marking a rejuvenation as well as a polarisation of French politics.

### The Republican race for second place

Only two Republican candidates will appear at the party’s [presidential primary](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-republican-primaries-tracker) debates on Wednesday. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, and Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, may have hoped to contend with Donald Trump directly for the Republican nomination by this point. But the two are still battling each other for a distant second place days before the Iowa caucuses take place. Mr Trump maintains a prohibitive lead in Iowa, and nationally. Both his runners-up, though, will be hoping to put in a strong performance that provides momentum for their campaigns.

Mr Trump has skipped all the debates, and voters haven’t punished him for this risk-averse approach. On this occasion the former president instead will take part in a town hall in Iowa with Fox News. Expect Mr Trump to generate headlines that distract from his rivals’ discussion. At a town hall in December, he promised not to be a dictator “except for day one”.

### NATO’s hand-wringing over Ukraine

Diplomats from Ukraine and NATO countries will meet on Wednesday to discuss a response to relentless Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities. But the West’s promise to [support Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/04/how-backing-ukraine-is-key-to-the-wests-security) “for as long as it takes” (repeated at the last NATO-Ukraine council in November) is starting to sound hollow.

In December America released what it says will be the last military-aid package for Ukraine until Congress makes more money available. But Republicans are blocking President Joe Biden’s request for $61bn-worth of civilian and military assistance to Ukraine, which is part of a broader proposal that includes aid for Israel and Taiwan. The Republicans are demanding reforms to curb migration across America’s southern border as the price of voting for the aid. Hungary, meanwhile, has blocked a four-year package of EU aid to Ukraine worth €50bn ($55bn).

This week Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, berated his fellow European leaders for providing insufficient help to Ukraine. When even arms-averse Germany finds the level of military aid to be too low, you know it’s inadequate.

### “The Sopranos”, 25 years on

On January 10th 1999 HBO subscribers first saw the cigar-chomping Tony Soprano. Across its six seasons, “The Sopranos” took the Mafia story, and television itself, to new places.

David Chase, its creator, gave the mob a new sensibility, structuring [the television series](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/01/09/the-sopranos-offered-a-dark-distortion-of-the-american-dream) around Tony’s sessions with his therapist. They talk through the problems plaguing not only his family—an imperious mother, frustrated wife, rebellious daughter and feckless son—but also the Family. The two intertwine in richly textured episodes that contrast Tony’s desire to be accepted into middle-class society with his addiction to cruelty.

“The Sopranos” was ambitious and ambiguous: its famous finale cuts out just as Tony and his family sit down for what could be his last supper. In recent years the show has found fans in a new generation. Some left-leaning young people appreciate it as a critique of capitalism. In the saga of Tony Soprano, America still sees a cracked reflection of itself.
