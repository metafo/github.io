Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Heavy fighting between **Israel** and **Hamas** was reported in Jabalia, a refugee camp in northern Gaza. The Hamas-run local authority said that there were about 100,000 people in the camp. On Wednesday, the UN’s secretary-general, **António Guterres**, invoked a power in the UN charter—unused since 1989— to warn the Security Council of a “severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system” [in Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/06/israel-is-pushing-into-southern-gaza-as-the-clock-ticks-down). He also reiterated his call for a humanitarian ceasefire. The UAE, a member of the Council, said it had submitted a draft resolution for a vote on a ceasefire. America has previously vetoed similar motions.

**America** announced it will conduct joint-military flights with **Guyana**, as tensions escalate between the South American country and neighbouring **Venezuela**. On Tuesday Nicolás Maduro, **Venezuela’s** president, told the country’s state-owned firms to begin exploiting oil, gas and mines in Essequibo, a region of Guyana which Venezuela claims as its own. On Sunday Venezuela held a [misguided](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/12/04/venezuelas-autocrat-nicolas-maduro-threatens-to-annex-guyana) referendum that Mr Maduro said backed his sovereignty push.

**Britain** accused **Russia’s** main intelligence service, the FSB, of sustained **cyber-attacks** designed to interfere with British politics. It said a group within the Russian spy agency had targeted politicians, civil servants, journalists, NGOs and other civil society organisations. The British government has sanctioned two individuals believed to be involved, and summoned the Russian ambassador.

After visiting Riyadh **Vladimir Putin**, Russia’s president, along with Muhammad bin-Salman, **Saudi Arabia**’s de-facto leader, urged OPEC and its allies to [curb oil production](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/29/an-unruly-opec-is-causing-problems-for-russia-and-saudi-arabia) to buoy prices. Last week the group settled on voluntary cuts of 2.2m barrels per day, but not all members—most notably, Iran—have signed on. Upon returning to Moscow Mr Putin hosted Iran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi, for talks.

**Denmark’s** parliament passed a law making it illegal to burn the **Koran** and other holy books. Far-right groups have carried out Koran burnings in both Denmark and Sweden, leading to international protests and [threats from Turkey](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/02/a-burnt-koran-holds-back-sweden-and-finland-from-joining-nato) that it would keep Sweden out of NATO. At home detractors see the law as infringing on free expression and pandering to foreign authoritarians.

**Advanced Micro Devices**, a chipmaker, launched an **artificial-intelligence processing chip** to compete with Nvidia’s H100, which dominates the market. The new chip has 153bn transistors, close to double that of its rival. Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI are planning to use it. AMD predicts that the [AI processor market](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/05/29/nvidia-is-not-the-only-firm-cashing-in-on-the-ai-gold-rush) will be worth $400bn by 2027.

**McDonald’s**, a fast-food chain, announced the launch of **CosMs’s,** a new type of restaurant in America named after an alien mascot first used in the 1980s. Ten stores, serving a smaller, sweeter menu, will open by the end of 2024. The move came as part of an ambitious growth plan revealed on Wednesday but the company’s shares were little changed by the news.

### America goes cold on Ukraine

Ukraine’s ability to beat back Russia has mostly been shaped by events happening far from the front lines—in Washington, DC. But the mood in America has been souring. On Monday an influential article in the *Washington Post* outlined criticisms of Ukraine’s counter-offensive, attributed to sources at the Pentagon, claiming that Ukraine has misused American aid. On Tuesday Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, abruptly cancelled a call with America’s Senate which would have requested more military aid. He must have known his plea would fall on deaf ears.

On Wednesday [Republicans](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/26/the-republican-party-no-longer-believes-america-is-the-essential-nation) in the Senate blocked President Joe Biden’s funding bill, which includes $61bn for Ukraine (and $14bn for Israel), demanding that aid be tied to immigration reforms. Mr Biden has said that he is prepared to make “significant compromises” on border security to get the funding passed, but they may not be significant enough for the Republican right. With just a week before the Senate adjourns for the holidays, Mr Zelensky’s winter looks bleak.

### A better balance for America’s economy

America’s labour market may be in a sweet spot. Figures on Friday are expected to show that the country added 190,000 jobs in November, up from 150,000 in October. But the difference probably resulted from auto workers and Hollywood actors ending their strikes. Excluding these additions, job growth would be about the same, a sign of stabilisation at a solid level: neither too hot, nor too cold.


More good news came earlier this week when separate data showed that job openings fell to 8.7m in October, the lowest since March 2021. The number of job openings per unemployed worker is now down to about 1.3, well below the record high of nearly two in early 2022, when companies were struggling to fill vacancies. A better balance in the supply of and demand for [workers](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/28/welcome-to-a-golden-age-for-workers) will probably translate into easing wage pressures and, ultimately, slowing inflation.

### The EU’s scramble to find new money

The pandemic was awful for the European Union, but a boon for its big spenders. Deficit rules were suspended to allow members to fork out whatever was needed to support their economies. The EU borrowed to set aside a whopping €807bn ($781bn) for the bloc’s [recovery fund](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/05/26/the-eus-covid-19-recovery-fund-has-changed-how-europe-spends-money), set up in 2020 to help poorer states. Now interest rates are much higher and budgets tighter. And other shocks, such as the war in Ukraine, are also weighing on members. At a meeting that will run until Friday finance ministers are negotiating who will bear the costs; EU leaders will make the final decision next week.

Long-term financial support for Ukraine, ever more important as [America waivers](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/europe-needs-to-step-up-support-for-ukraine), will cost around €50bn in grants and loans. Help for southern states to manage migration will add €15bn. The old deficit rules will come back into force in 2024, though they will be harder to apply. Proposals to give highly indebted countries, such as Italy, more time to bring down debt, are controversial. The EU is having a rude awakening from its [fiscal fantasyland](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/04/governments-are-living-in-a-fiscal-fantasyland).

### The comeback of Notre-Dame

A year from Friday the gothic cathedral of Notre-Dame is due to re-open its doors, five years after a[ devastating fire](https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/04/17/france-agonises-over-the-fire-that-devastated-notre-dame) toppled its spire and destroyed much of its roof. To mark the countdown Emmanuel Macron will visit the site in Paris. The French president will observe the rebuilding of the 70m-long oak spire (based on the 19th-century *flèche* which was destroyed).

The reconstruction is a political test for Mr Macron, who is struggling in the polls. Hours after the fire broke out in 2019, he vowed to rebuild in five years. That was an ambitious timescale.

Not everything will be finished when the doors re-open. But it is broadly on schedule. This has been possible thanks to the generosity of French (and some international) donors, who are providing the bulk of the financing. The total cost of reconstruction is expected to be €700m ($755m), which is, remarkably, less than the €840m secured in a national fundraiser.

### Art taking on autocracy

This weekend Coco Fusco, a Cuban-American artist, plays the role of a literary agent for Antigone, a figure from Greek mythology who represents resistance to authority, on stage in Berlin. In “Antigone is Not Available Right Now”, Ms Fusco fields requests from an Iranian film director, a Russian punk band and a Cuban theatre troupe hoping to employ Antigone’s moral standing against dictatorial regimes. But Antigone is tired and hiding in Hades. She is sceptical, says Ms Fusco, “about whether human beings today really want democracy anymore.”


The show is part of an exhibition on Ms Fusco’s career as a performance and video artist being held at the KW Institute for Contemporary Art. Much of Ms Fusco's work has been a critique of Western imperialism, dressing up in 1992 as an “undiscovered” Amerindian tribesperson to lampoon the European “discovery” of the Americas. Later works spotlight state repression and torture in Cuba and America. Her laudable goal is “art-making that disrupts complacency.”
