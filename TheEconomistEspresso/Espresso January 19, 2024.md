Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Iran** summoned **Pakistan’s** envoy over a strike near their border. Pakistan said it had conducted “precision military strikes” inside Iran, and killed “a number of terrorists”. Iranian authorities say nine people were killed, including women and children. The attack came two days after Iran launched similar strikes against militants operating in Pakistan. On Wednesday Pakistan recalled its ambassador from Iran, and temporarily suspended all high-level visits between the two countries.

**Binyamin Netanyahu** said he had told **America** that he opposes a Palestinian state after the war. “Israel needs security control over all territory west of the Jordan,” he said at a press conference. Later a spokesperson for America’s state department said there would be “no way” to solve the country's long-term security problems “without the establishment of a Palestinian state”.

America’s **Congress** passed a [stop-gap spending bill](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/08/the-us-congress-remains-far-from-the-finish-line-of-a-budget-deal) to keep the government funded until March. The legislation cleared the House of Representatives with bipartisan support, despite an eleventh-hour campaign by hardline Republicans to stymie it. **Mike Johnson**, the Republican House speaker who earlier promised not to pass short-term extensions, could face consequences for his stand against the far-right Freedom Caucus.

**OPEC** said it expects global oil demand to remain robust in 2024 and 2025, owing to a strong global growth forecast and slowing inflation. Oil prices ticked up on the news. In contrast to [OPEC’s forecast](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/29/an-unruly-opec-is-causing-problems-for-russia-and-saudi-arabia), the **IEA** said that growth in oil demand will halve in 2024 because of China’s slow economic recovery and greater take-up of electric vehicles.

The police response to a [mass shooting](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/21/a-report-sheds-light-on-the-deadliest-school-shooting-in-texass-history) at an elementary school in **Uvalde**, Texas, in 2022 was “a failure”, **America’s** Justice Department concluded in a report. The shooter remained inside the school for 77 minutes, killing 19 children and two teachers. The gravest mistake was that officers failed to neutralise the gunman immediately, instead asking for back-up for what they classified as “a stand-off”.

[Birkenstock](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/12/why-young-consumers-love-birkenstocks)’s share price fell on Thursday after the company published its first earnings results since going public last October. The sandal-maker said revenue could grow by as much as 18% in 2024, but **investors** were disappointed as they had become increasingly optimistic about the company’s outlook. Weaker demand prospects for other footwear companies such as **Nike** also contributed to negative sentiment.

**Tata Steel** will reportedly shut down its Port Talbot blast furnaces in Wales, putting 3,000 jobs at risk. The closure of Britain’s biggest [steel](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/02/09/steelmaking-in-britain-has-to-get-greener-but-wholl-pay) plant would leave the country on course to become the only major economy unable to make steel from scratch. The company will instead build electric- arc furnaces, which make steel from recycled scrap—a greener and cheaper process.

### Boom and gloom for America’s economy

Judging from an array of hard data, there is reason to think that Americans ought to be quite satisfied with the state of their economy. Inflation has slowed sharply, jobs are plentiful and the stockmarket is strong. But polls suggest that most Americans think the economy is in bad shape, a tide of pessimism which may hurt President Joe Biden’s [re-election bid](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/31/joe-bidens-re-election-bid-is-in-trouble).

The January instalment of a consumer sentiment survey by the University of Michigan, a closely-watched barometer of views about the economy, is due on Friday. It will be studied for clues about whether the gloom is starting to dissipate. The sentiment index jumped in December, though it remained low by historical standards. Some analysts believe there is a long lag between changes in the inflation rate and those in public opinion. If so, this is about the time that Americans [may start to feel ](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/14/why-are-americans-so-gloomy-about-their-great-economy)more cheerful.

### One small step for Japan

SLIM, an unmanned spacecraft built by JAXA, Japan’s space agency, is due to attempt a “soft landing” on the Moon on Friday. If the mission succeeds, Japan will become the fifth country to make a lunar landing without crippling its equipment, following [India’s](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/23/indias-lunar-triumph)*[ Chandrayaan-3](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/23/indias-lunar-triumph)* in August.

SLIM’s main goal is to test a new landing technology that could transform space exploration. Whereas conventional landers touch down on the Moon within a range of tens of kilometres, SLIM boasts an accuracy of 100 metres. Such precision is helpful as countries seek to study the Moon’s resources, including ice around the [south pole](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/08/16/why-the-lunar-south-pole-is-the-latest-focus-in-the-new-space-race).

If all goes according to plan, two small robots, one designed by a toy company, will hop out of JAXA’s spacecraft. They will examine Shioli, a crater on the Moon’s near side, because rocks in that area are believed to contain minerals from the lunar mantle. Studying those rocks could unlock the secrets to the Moon’s origins.

### Duelling abortion marches in America

Anti-abortion protesters will rally in Washington, DC, on Friday for the annual “March for Life”. Many may lament Ron DeSantis’s showing in the [Iowa caucuses](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/16/donald-trump-does-exactly-what-he-was-expected-to-do), where he came a [distant second](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/18/how-did-the-iowa-result-change-the-republican-primary) to Donald Trump. Florida’s governor is the most vocally anti-abortion of the Republican presidential candidates: last April he signed a ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. Mr Trump called that a “terrible mistake”. Nikki Haley, another contender, has told pro-lifers to be “honest” about the unpopularity of draconian abortion restrictions. Polls say most Americans think the procedure should be legal in the first trimester.

The following day pro-choice campaigners will descend on Phoenix, Arizona. The state bans abortion after 15 weeks. The protesters want to gather signatures to hold a ballot measure to allow abortions until [fetal viability](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/23/why-does-america-allow-abortions-until-fetal-viability) (around 23 weeks). Democrats see such campaigns as a way to boost electoral turnout, as pro-choice voters still seethe from the overturning of *Roe v Wade* in 2022.

### Growing violence in Brazil

Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (known as Lula), is to appoint a new justice and public-security minister on Friday. The choice of Ricardo Lewandowski, a former justice of the Supreme Court, shows that Lula is cosying up to the judiciary. It has decided the fate of several politicians in recent times—and ruled on topics being discussed in Congress.

Mr Lewandowski’s biggest job is to deal with a wave of [violence](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/05/14/south-americas-biggest-gang-has-immense-sway-in-brazil) sweeping the country. In September 68 people died because of gang conflicts in Bahia, a state governed by Lula’s Workers’ Party. In October a militia set 35 buses on fire in Rio de Janeiro after the police killed one of their leaders. The followers of Lula’s far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, also pose a threat; thousands [invaded government buildings](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/12/a-copycat-insurrection-in-brazil-and-its-troubling-aftermath) last January. A recent poll found that 47% of Brazilians disapprove of the government’s domestic-security policy. Mr Lewandowski says he will prioritise “the big challenge” of maintaining order.

### Arab and Israeli musicians reckon with war

On Friday Daniel Barenboim, an Israeli-Argentine conductor and pianist, is due to lead a performance of students from the [Barenboim-Said Academy](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/01/09/berlins-unique-new-music-academy), a conservatoire he opened in Berlin in 2016. Such occasions have political poignancy. The academy’s students largely come from the Middle East, and include Israelis and Palestinians. Its mission is to foster not only musical ability, but also understanding across the region’s cultural and political divides.

The idea stemmed from the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, a now world-famous ensemble that Mr Barenboim founded in 1999 with Edward Said, an American-Palestinian academic. It also encourages dialogue and co-operation between Arab and Israeli musicians. War in Gaza has [affected both projects deeply](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/01/11/two-arab-israeli-musical-initiatives-reckon-with-the-war-in-gaza). Yet the determination to play on is telling. Classical music cannot play a meaningful role in diplomacy. Still, the initiatives provide alternative models of engagement. If you change how people meet, they may treat each other differently.
