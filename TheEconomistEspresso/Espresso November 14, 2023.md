## The world in brief

### November 14, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Joe Biden** said that **Gaza’s hospitals** “must be protected”, as **Israeli forces** [reached](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/12/as-israel-fights-on-in-gaza-its-dilemma-gets-worse) the entrance of the al-Shifa hospital, the enclave’s largest. Israel’s army [claims](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/06/israeli-soldiers-fight-to-reach-hamass-headquarters) that Hamas uses tunnels beneath al-Shifa and other hospitals in Gaza city for its operations. Meanwhile al-Shifa, lacking fuel and electricity, has stopped functioning, according to a spokesperson for the World Health Organisation, who said it had become “nearly a cemetery”. According to Gaza’s health ministry, thousands of people are sheltering within the complex.

**David Cameron**, a former British prime minister, became foreign secretary in a cabinet reshuffle seven years after he resigned his leadership. The move came after Rishi Sunak, the current prime minister, sacked **Suella Braverman**, the home secretary, for writing an [unauthorised article](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/08/suella-braverman-uses-a-pro-palestinian-march-to-sow-discord) criticising London’s police over their handling of pro-Palestinian protests. James Cleverly, the former foreign secretary, replaced her.

America’s **Supreme Court** adopted its first-ever [code of conduct](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/06/americas-supreme-court-should-adopt-new-ethics-standards). The written requirements, which the court said are mostly “not new”, come after media reports revealed that two conservative justices [failed](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/12/the-real-questions-raised-by-clarence-thomass-latest-scandal) to disclose gifts—including luxury travel and property deals—paid for by Republican donors. It is unclear how the rules are to be enforced.

**America** carried out more airstrikes against targets in **eastern Syria**. American officials said the sites were linked to [Iran and its proxies](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/05/the-gaza-war-has-deepened-joe-bidens-iran-nightmare) in the region, which America blames for recent attacks on its troops in Iraq and Syria. Warplanes hit a training facility and a safe house. The strikes are the third of their kind since late October.

**Pakistan** opened three new border crossings with **Afghanistan** to facilitate the departure of undocumented migrants, following a [government ruling](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/10/12/pakistan-expels-undocumented-afghans-but-at-what-price) that they must leave or be expelled. Around 1.7m Afghans were affected by the declaration, which told those without papers to leave by November 1st. More than 280,000 have left since the declaration was made on October 3rd, according to the UN.

**China** criticised a potential deal between [Zambia](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/29/new-forms-of-debt-restructuring-reward-bad-behaviour) and international bondholders, saying that other creditors should take a “fair burden” in the country’s debt restructuring. Zambia agreed a deal in principle in late October, three years after it defaulted. But China and the International Monetary Fund have voiced concerns over the agreement, perhaps because bondholders would reportedly receive greater repayments than official creditors.

French police thwarted a theft of €600,000 ($640,000) worth of **champagne** but failed to capture the thieves. Two lorries carrying bottles from Moët & Chandon were reported stolen on Saturday. Police found them on the motorway between Reims in the Champagne region and Paris. Following a high-speed chase, the drivers fled the vehicles and escaped.

### The battle for al-Shifa hospital

Outside al-Shifa hospital a battle rages: Israeli troops are fighting Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. Inside the hospital, Gaza’s largest, are thousands of wounded and displaced people. Medics say that they have run out of fuel to operate their generators. The Israeli army accuses Hamas of putting its [headquarters](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/06/israeli-soldiers-fight-to-reach-hamass-headquarters) in a web of tunnels underneath the hospital. It has advanced to within a few hundred metres of the facility.

The Israeli government has not yet [given the order](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/12/as-israel-fights-on-in-gaza-its-dilemma-gets-worse) for troops to enter it. That is partly because it hopes to negotiate a deal to free some of the roughly 240 [hostages](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/11/03/israels-top-hostage-negotiator-on-dealing-with-hamas) held in Gaza by Hamas and other militant groups. Talks are ongoing in Qatar and Egypt. Whether they succeed or not, though, Israeli troops will probably enter al-Shifa in the coming days. Other hospitals in Gaza have already had to evacuate after running out of fuel and coming under fire.

### Inflation eases in India

Indians celebrated the festival of Diwali on Sunday by lighting fireworks and exchanging presents. But the country's central bankers are hoping to receive their gift on Monday. That is when inflation data for October will be released. Economists believe that consumer-price growth will fall to 4.8% year on year, down from 5% in September. The fourth consecutive monthly decline would bring inflation closer to the Reserve Bank of India's target of 4%.

The figures will be vindication for Shaktikanta Das, the RBI’s governor, who resisted raising [interest rates](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/02/markets-think-interest-rates-could-stay-high-for-a-decade-or-more) even as the inflation rate jumped to more than 7% in July. That spike, he insisted, was temporary because it was caused by an erratic monsoon season, which [disrupted food production](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/08/28/indias-surging-food-prices-are-a-problem-not-just-for-india). Slowing inflation would also be a gift for India's prime minister, [Narendra Modi](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/08/narendra-modi-and-the-art-of-claiming-credit). His Bharatiya Janata Party is competing in five state elections this month in which nearly a sixth of the Indian electorate will vote. Easing prices, especially for food, could improve its chances.

### Poland’s parliament regroups

On Monday MPs will fill the 460 seats in Poland’s parliament for the first time since [an election](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/15/poland-gives-pro-european-liberals-a-big-win) in October. There will be 117 fresh faces. But the main change is that, after eight years of rule, the [Law and Justice](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/17/poland-shows-that-populists-can-be-beaten) (PiS) party no longer commands a majority in the Sejm, the more powerful lower house.

In calling the first parliamentary session, [Poland’s](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/06/15/what-to-read-to-understand-modern-poland) president, Andrzej Duda, said he would give the largest party’s candidate to be prime minister—in this case, Mateusz Morawiecki, the current PiS prime minister—a first go at forming a government. Mr Morawiecki is almost certain to fail. The opposition, which plans to rule in a sprawling coalition, has a majority in parliament. On November 10th its leaders signed a formal agreement. But PiS is playing for time. A few extra weeks in power could allow it to entrench more cronies and sign long-term contracts in both public institutions and state-owned companies.

### Rohingya rights in Bangladesh

On Monday a panel from the UN Human Rights Council will discuss its latest report on human rights in Bangladesh and assess conditions there. Its conclusions will not be favourable.

Since 2017 nearly 1m[ Rohingyas](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/26/the-rohingyas-long-for-their-homes-in-myanmar-but-cannot-go-back), a Muslim people from Rakhine state in[ majority-Buddhist Myanmar](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/18/myanmars-shadow-government-deserves-more-help), have sought refuge in Bangladesh. They have fled persecution so brutal that the UN has deemed it to be a[ genocide](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/10/how-the-term-genocide-is-misused-in-the-israel-hamas-war). Myanmar’s government, which claims that the Rohingya are immigrants, gives them no rights. Their rights are also restricted in refugee camps in Bangladesh. Rohingya are confined to the camps by barbed-wire fences, a practice that violates international law. Police-enabled gang violence is rampant.

The UN report is unlikely to spur Bangladesh to improve conditions. According to Bangladesh’s government, China is trying to help it move 3,000 Rohingya back to Myanmar. Fortify Rights, a human-rights watchdog, calls the plan “premature and dangerous”. Whether in Bangladesh or Myanmar, the Rohingyas’ future is bleak.

### The many lives of Louisa May Alcott

Before publishing “Little Women” in 1869, Louisa May Alcott used various pseudonyms to experiment with different writing styles. There was A.M. Barnard for thrillers, Flora Fairfield for poetry and the delightful Tribulation Periwinkle for letters. Max Chapnick, an academic at Northeastern University in Boston, believes he has found more aliases.

Mr Chapnick says that Alcott may have penned seven stories, five poems and one piece of non-fiction under the names E. Gould and I.H. Gould. The discovery was the result of literary detective work. Mr Chapnick cross-referenced a list of lost stories by Alcott with pieces published by her favoured outlets. The Goulds’ work has stylistic similarities to Alcott’s. Two pieces feature characters named Alcott and one mentions a house she once lived in.

If Mr Chapnick is correct, his finding will deepen readers’ understanding of Alcott’s oeuvre. He describes one of the stories, “The Phantom”, as a feminist take on Charles Dickens’s “A Christmas Carol”.
