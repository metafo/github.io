### September 22, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Rupert Murdoch** announced that he would step down as chairman of [Fox Corporation](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/03/13/rupert-murdoch-prepares-to-hand-over-his-media-empire) (the parent company of Fox News) and News Corp, which owns newspapers including the Wall Street Journal. His son, Lachlan, will now run both companies. In a memo to employees, Mr Murdoch wrote that the “time is right for me to take on different roles”.

**Kevin McCarthy**, the [embattled](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/21/americas-dumbest-wildest-budget-fight-yet) speaker of the **American** House of Representatives, suffered defeat as conservative Republicans blocked a defence spending bill for the third time. The bill is one of 12 that must be passed to avoid a government shutdown on October 1st. Mr McCarthy and moderate Republicans have tried to pass stopgap funding to extend the deadline, so far without success.

**Russia** barred the export of petrol and diesel, except to Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Russia is a global supplier of petrol and diesel, even after the EU and America banned most imports of refined fuel from the country in February. Oil prices are already high; Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, almost hit $96 per barrel on Tuesday, its highest price in 10 months.

The **Bank of England** kept its benchmark [interest rate](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/07/27/how-high-should-britains-interest-rates-go) at 5.25%, its first pause in nearly two years. The bank’s decision followed promising inflation figures—the annual rate unexpectedly slowed to 6.7% in August, from 6.8% in July. On Wednesday the Federal Reserve left its interest rate unchanged but signalled support for another hike this year.

**Pakistan**’s electoral commission announced that general elections will be held next January. The timing of the forthcoming vote has been controversial, amid the army’s [growing influence](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/10/pakistans-army-is-back-in-charge-of-politics) over the country’s politics. Imran Khan, the former prime minister, has been banned from running as he battles charges of corruption and sedition, which he claims are politically motivated.

**India** suspended granting visas to **Canadians** for “operational reasons”, as a row between the countries over the murder of a Canadian Sikh in June escalates. Canada alleges that Indian secret services were involved in the shooting of [Hardeep Singh Nijjar](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/20/if-india-ordered-a-murder-in-canada-there-must-be-consequences) in Vancouver. Mr Nijjar, labelled a terrorist by India, campaigned for the establishment of a Sikh separatist state in northern India.

Seventeen writers, including George R.R. Martin, the author of Game of Thrones, sued **OpenAI**, the startup that created ChatGPT. They allege that the chatbot relies on “systematic theft” of copyrighted works, citing examples including a detailed outline generated for a “Game of Thrones” prequel. OpenAI said that it respects “the rights of writers and authors”.

### Will Japan maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy?

The Bank of Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy of negative short-term interest rates, aimed at tackling deflation, appears to be at a crossroads. In July Ueda Kazuo, the central bank’s governor, [surprised markets](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/28/the-bank-of-japan-jolts-global-markets) by tweaking its yield-curve control policy, allowing ten-year government-bond yields to rise up to 1%. When the BoJ concludes a two-day meeting on Friday, it will probably refrain from further changes to observe how the new set-up plays out.

But another shift may come soon. Inflation is at last reaching Japan: in July consumer prices, including energy but not fresh food, rose by 3.1% year on year. And the gap between American and Japanese interest rates has dragged the yen to a historic low of 150 to the dollar, causing Japan’s government to worry about rising import prices and higher costs of living. Mr Ueda seems to share the concern—and has hinted at the possibility of raising short-term rates.

### America’s auto strike intensifies

The [auto strike](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/20/americas-big-car-firms-face-lengthy-strikes) in Detroit is about to get nastier. The United Auto Workers, one of America’s biggest unions, has set a deadline of noon on Friday for “serious progress” in talks with Ford, GM and Stellantis (whose biggest shareholder part-owns *The Economist*’s parent company). Failing that, the union has vowed more stoppages. It has so far limited its strike to 13,000 workers. But with 146,000 members who could potentially walk off the job, the UAW has scope to ratchet up the pressure while demanding a pay increase of 40%.

The politics around the strike are getting more contentious, too. Donald Trump plans to visit Detroit next Wednesday, delivering a speech to union members instead of joining a Republican presidential primary debate. Joe Biden, [America’s most pro-union president](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/13/joe-bidens-love-of-unions-runs-into-a-giant-strike) in decades, has stayed away from the picket lines, judging that it is better to leave space for the talks. Yet he is also leaving space for Mr Trump.

### An unwelcome spat over Ukrainian grain

Eastern Europe’s food fight is turning ugly. On Monday Ukraine complained to the World Trade Organisation after Hungary, Poland and Slovakia banned imports of its grain, citing distortions in their domestic markets. Ukraine said it could retaliate with bans on Polish onions and apples, as well as Hungarian cars, if the embargoes remained in place by a deadline on Friday. Slovakia struck a deal. But Poland said it would [halt new supplies of arms](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/21/why-poland-is-halting-its-supply-of-weapons-to-ukraine) to its war-battered neighbour, escalating tensions.

The Polish brinkmanship is chiefly intended for a domestic audience ahead of an election on October 15th. Polish farmers, an important voter base for the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, are disgruntled by the influx of Ukrainian grain that has dragged down prices. But PiS’s posturing could have dangerous consequences. It risks denting [Europe’s united front against Russia](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/30/poland-is-being-given-an-opportunity-to-matter-in-europe), and setting an unwelcome precedent for any other country that may seek an excuse to weaken [its support](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/12/who-is-doing-most-to-help-ukraine-against-russia) for Ukraine.

### The global battle against tuberculosis

At the UN General Assembly in New York in 2018, world leaders formally committed to wiping out tuberculosis—the cause of around 1.5m deaths each year—by 2030. On Friday, at this year’s UNGA, delegates will gather for the second-ever high-level meeting on the disease.

It will be a sorry session. TB’s mortality rate declined steadily for decades, but that trend suddenly reversed in recent years. The main reason was the [covid-19 pandemic](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/10/27/how-one-pandemic-made-another-one-worse). Covid cases clogged up health services and diverted resources away from TB; lockdowns forced sick and healthy people into closer quarters. Poor countries, where TB is most prevalent, were the worst affected.

But there are some reasons for hope. In June the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome, two of the world’s wealthiest charities, announced that they would fund a late-stage trial of a [new TB vaccine](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/06/28/a-new-tb-vaccine-could-save-85m-lives-over-the-next-quarter-of-a-century). It could, they claim, prevent 76m cases, and save some 8.5m lives, over the next 25 years.

### Reassessing Marc Bolan’s legacy

Marc Bolan, the leader of T. Rex, a British rock band, is far from forgotten. He was, after all, one of the first gender-bending stars of the glam-rock era. But his legacy is often set against that of David Bowie, a more famous British contemporary. The comparison makes Bolan, a musical meteor who burned brightly but briefly, dying in a car crash in 1977, aged just 29, look a relatively marginal figure.

A new documentary, “Marc Bolan: Angelheaded Hipster”, challenges that narrative. The film follows the creation of a tribute album to Bolan, which features not only long-established stars like U2 and Nick Cave, but also younger acts like Kesha and BØRNS. Their presence makes a strong case for Bolan’s musical legacy being much more than a handful of hit singles. The film highlights his underappreciated talent as a songwriter of subtlety and depth—and suggests he was an artist unafraid to pursue new ideas.
