Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

World leaders reacted after Emmanuel Macron, **France’s** president, said that European and allied leaders had not reached “a consensus” on whether to send troops to [Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/02/21/is-ukraine-losing-the-war-against-russia), but that “nothing should be ruled out”. America disagreed, saying that the “path to victory” is instead for Congress to allow more military aid to the country. Olaf Scholz, **Germany’s** chancellor, said that European and NATO countries had determined “from the beginning” not to send soldiers to “Ukrainian soil”. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, warned against the move, saying that it would be “absolutely not in the interests of these countries”.

President **Joe Biden** said that he believed **Israel** would halt military activities in [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/22/the-wrecking-of-gazas-health-system-goes-beyond-its-hospitals) during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month that begins on March 10th. Hamas is reportedly considering the proposal for a 40-day ceasefire, but indicated that negotiators were not as close to an agreement as Mr Biden had suggested. A possible deal would see 40 Israeli hostages released in exchange for 400 Palestinian prisoners, according to Reuters.

The **European Union** parliament voted to approve an environmental-conservation bill. The legislation says that EU countries should restore 20% of land and sea areas by 2030. [Europe’s farmers](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/01/europes-grumpy-farmers-are-a-symptom-of-wider-malaise) have protested against green initiatives for weeks, blocking roads and railways. They say that limits on chemicals and caps on greenhouse-gas emissions would adversely affect their livelihoods.

A **Russian** court sentenced **Oleg Orlov** to two and a half years in prison for denouncing his country’s war in Ukraine. The human-rights campaigner was a co-chair of the Memorial Human Rights Centre, which shared the Nobel peace prize in 2022, a year after being shut down by [the Kremlin](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/08/vladimir-putin-extends-his-crackdown-in-russia). Mr Orlov accused Russian troops of committing “mass murder” in Ukraine.

Tammy Duckworth, a Democratic senator, promised to bring legislation federally protecting **IVF** to America’s Senate floor. Last week **Alabama’s** Supreme Court ruled that embryos were children, leaving Republicans scrambling to publicly back IVF as several [fertility clinics](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2023-07-22) paused treatment. Earlier Democrats convinced Republican lawmakers in **Florida** to halt progress on a bill that would have broadly protected an “unborn child”.

Macky Sall, **Senegal’s** president, said he would propose a “general amnesty” bill to the country’s National Assembly on Wednesday. It would pardon those detained in political demonstrations between 2021 and 2024. Mr Sall triggered a constitutional crisis when he called off the country’s presidential [election](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/04/senegals-democracy-hangs-by-a-thread) originally scheduled for February 25th. He said that the new bill might “pacify the political arena”.

A **Dutch** court sentenced **Ridouan Taghi**, a [drug kingpin](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/06/12/europes-drug-habit-proves-immune-to-covid-19), to life in prison. Mr Taghi was on trial for murders and attempted murders between 2015 and 2017. He was arrested in Dubai in 2019 and extradited to the Netherlands. The case is one of the country’s biggest: it involved 17 defendants and a case file of more than 100,000 pages.

### Figure of the day: 

**$531m**, the amount of funding that Mistral, a French rival to OpenAI, has received from investors in under a year. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/26/meet-the-french-startup-hoping-to-take-on-openai).

### Correction: 

An earlier edition of The World in Brief described a renewable-energy project in Gujarat as the world’s largest solar park. It is in fact a hybrid wind and solar facility. Sorry.

### Hopes for a truce in Gaza

Nearly 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th. An end to [the war](https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/10/17/israel-gaza-map-hamas-war) is not yet in sight. Israel still plans to launch an offensive against Hamas’s last stronghold in [Rafah](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/13/if-israel-invades-hell-looms-in-rafah), a city in southern Gaza, where more than 1m refugees are huddled.

But a respite may come soon. Following talks in Paris, Israel has tabled a proposal for a 40-day truce. The deal would probably include the release of 40 of the more than 130 Israeli hostages held by Hamas. In return Israel would free 400 Palestinian prisoners. The militant group has yet to respond to the proposal but it is also eager for a pause, especially during the fasting month of Ramadan, which begins on March 11th. On Monday President Joe Biden said that he hopes a ceasefire will begin by the start of next week. That may be optimistic. The first day of Ramadan seems more likely.

### Russia’s booming economy

A slew of data released on Wednesday will probably show that Russia’s economy is expanding rapidly. The unemployment rate is hovering around 3%, an all-time low. Wages are growing strongly, even after taking into account high inflation. Growth in corporate profits and industrial production is also expected to be high. Economists reckon that by the end of last year Russia’s economy was growing by about 4% year on year, far faster than most of the rich world. What gives?

Western sanctions have had less impact on Russian GDP than expected, in part because many businesses have reoriented trade to Asia. The government is also [spending big](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/10/31/what-russias-new-budget-reveals-about-the-war-in-ukraine) on defence production and procurement, which is putting money in people’s pockets. [Inflation remains high](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/10/vladimir-putin-is-running-russias-economy-dangerously-hot), as expansive fiscal policy has run up against constrained supply. But relative to expectations in early 2022, the Russian economy is doing troublingly well.

### Hong Kong doubles down on suppression

One draconian national-security law ought to be enough for any territory—particularly Hong Kong, which has already been comprehensively [cowed](https://www.economist.com/interactive/essay/2022/07/01/how-hong-kong-became-a-police-state) by the version thrust upon it by the Chinese government in 2020. But Hong Kong is constitutionally required to introduce its own national-security legislation, called [Article 23](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/01/31/hong-kong-gets-a-second-draconian-security-law), under the terms of its handback to China in 1997. On January 30th John Lee, Hong Kong’s leader, unveiled his proposal for the law.

The public consultation over it ends on Wednesday. Not that the public’s view carries much sway. The last time Article 23 was proposed, in 2003, huge protests felled the plan. Now, with dissent crushed by the existing national-security law, the consultation is a mere formality. Mr Lee has a free hand.

He has come round to the view, popular in Beijing, that shady foreign forces were behind pro-democracy protests in 2019. So his new law focuses on “external influence” and crimes such as espionage. Its vaguely worded provisions seem designed to chill foreign NGOs and press.

### The decline of the Geneva motor show

On Wednesday the Geneva motor show opens to the public after a five-year hiatus caused by the covid-19 pandemic. It was once perhaps Europe’s greatest car-industry gathering. But on the event’s return most big carmakers will be missing. Notable exceptions include Renault and [BYD, a Chinese firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/02/chinas-byd-is-overtaking-tesla-as-the-carmaker-extraordinaire).

Interest in shows like Geneva was waning even before the pandemic. Carmakers became less willing to spend heavily on such shindigs as consumers increasingly found their new cars on social media and the internet. Other big shows have also failed to bounce back after covid. Detroit, Paris and Munich (which recently replaced Frankfurt as the venue of Germany’s car extravaganza) have all radically downsized.

[The up-and-coming Chinese firms](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/04/14/cars-with-chinese-characteristics) still want to show off cars at big fairs. For a motor show that retains the buzz of yesteryear, head to Beijing or Shanghai.

### How to flog the treasures of a Venetian palazzo

Count Giovanni Volpi di Misurata is the son of Giuseppe Volpi, Italy’s finance minister under Benito Mussolini and founder of the Venice Film Festival. On Wednesday he and his wife will be decluttering their family’s 500-year-old palazzo in Venice with a big sale at [Sotheby’s](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/01/31/the-sothebys-trial-revealed-the-art-markets-unsavoury-practices) in Paris. The family no longer resides in the grand pile. But in its heyday, in the second half of the 20th century, countless balls were attended there by luminaries including Winston Churchill, Maria Callas, Paul Newman, Andy Warhol and the Rothschilds.

Up for grabs is not the building itself, but some 250 lots including chandeliers, Qing dynasty vases, a tapestry depicting a scene from the life of Alexander the Great and a set of 18th-century gilded tables with winged Venetian lions for feet. The auction is estimated to rake in up to around €2.4m ($2.6m). Not bad for a clear out.
