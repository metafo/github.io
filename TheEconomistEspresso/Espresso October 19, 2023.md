Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Rishi Sunak**, Britain’s prime minister, confirmed that he will travel to Israel and other unspecified Middle Eastern countries in a two-day visit starting on Thursday. He said that he will urge regional leaders to avoid “further dangerous escalation”. His American counterpart, President Joe Biden, concluded his own [trip to Tel Aviv](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/17/biden-steers-a-risky-course-in-the-israel-hamas-war) on Wednesday, where he appeared to secure an agreement from Israel to allow aid relief to enter Gaza through Egypt and announced $100m in humanitarian aid for Palestinians. He said he hoped to provide “unprecedented” aid to Israel, though the size of the package has not been released.

Earlier Mr Biden—and America’s National Security Council—backed Israel’s assertion that a misfired rocket shot by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group, caused an explosion at a **hospital in Gaza City**. Hamas blamed Israeli forces for the strike, which Palestinian officials claimed killed hundreds of people. The blast sparked protests, which continued on Wednesday, in the Israeli-occupied [West Bank](https://www.economist.com/the-war-in-gaza-may-mark-a-watershed-for-the-palestinian-authority) as well as several [Arab countries](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/18/the-arab-world-thinks-differently-about-this-war).

**Jim Jordan** lost a second vote to become speaker of **America’s** House of Representatives, securing even less support from fellow Republicans than he managed in the first. Twenty-two Republicans and all 212 Democrats supported other candidates, leaving Mr Jordan with 199 votes, short of the 217 he needed to clinch the position. The House has been [without](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/04/the-sacking-of-kevin-mccarthy-will-make-supporting-ukraine-harder) a permanent speaker since October 3rd.

**America’s** ten-year **Treasury yield** closed at 4.9%, a 16-year high. Since early August it has traded [in excess of 4%](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/forget-the-shutdown-americas-real-fiscal-worry-is-rising-bond-yields)—a level unseen from 2008 to 2021. Investors may be [bracing for turbulence](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/04/a-surge-in-global-bond-yields-threatens-trouble): global stock markets fell, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1%.

**Russia’s** president, Vladimir Putin, said that [America’s decision](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/22/america-says-it-will-send-long-range-missiles-to-ukraine) to deliver long-range ATACMS missiles to **Ukraine** was a “mistake”, after the rockets were used to strike Russian targets. Mr Putin made the comments in Beijing, where he met his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at a forum to mark the tenth anniversary of the [Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/17/how-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-is-changing), China’s infrastructure-investment programme.

**India’s** government said it would allow the export of non-basmati **white rice** to certain countries at risk of food shortages, easing a ban introduced in July. Seven countries will receive exports, including Malaysia and the Philippines in Asia, and Cameroon and Ivory Coast in Africa. India’s ban saw global prices of the [staple](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/28/the-global-rice-crisis) rise to their highest point in 15 years.

**Netflix** said its dreaded crack-down on password sharing has paid off. In the last quarter, it added 8.8m new subscribers, up from 2.4m during the same period last year. It also said it would raise some subscription fees in America, Britain and France. Its share price rose by more than 10% in after-hours trading on the news.

**$14m**, the approximate amount that the typical S&P 500 boss earned last year, around 250 times as much as the average worker. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/17/are-americas-ceos-overpaid).

### Gaza and the Arab world

By the time Israel denied responsibility for the explosion at Gaza’s al-Ahli hospital on Tuesday, whether or not the claim was true did not matter in much of [the Arab world](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/18/the-arab-world-thinks-differently-about-this-war). The catastrophe sparked protests as far away as Tunisia. They show that Palestinian suffering remains a potent issue across the region. Yet not as potent as it was. Attitudes among elites are more nuanced than they were during past conflicts between Israel and the militant groups [Hamas](https://www.economist.com/films/2023/10/13/what-is-hamas) and [Hizbullah](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-hizbullah).

Since 2020 four Arab states—Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates—have established diplomatic relations with Israel, which previously had ties with just Egypt and Jordan. Saudi Arabia has been in talks to do the same. That has changed the way some Arab media outlets cover the conflict. Some have stopped calling the Israeli army *jaish al-ihtilal* (“occupation army”).

Many Egyptians blame Hamas, and Lebanese blame [Hizbullah](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-hizbullah), for threatening to drag them into a war. Equally, many Arab officials have no sympathy for Islamist groups backed by Iran. As yet, however, they dare not air these thoughts in public.

### What next for the war in Ukraine?

As Ukraine’s counter-offensive has slowed down, Russia is attempting to seize the initiative. In recent days it launched a major offensive in [Avdiivka](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/14/now-russia-is-fighting-to-gain-territory-in-the-east-of-ukraine), a heavily contested town in Donetsk, an eastern province. The assault appears to have gone disastrously, resulting in huge losses. But it is a warning of things to come.

Recent satellite images suggest that North Korea has sent a large shipment of arms to Russia by rail and sea. That includes a huge stock of artillery shells, the most valuable commodity on the battlefield. Ukraine has benefited from an arms infusion of its own. On October 17th it fired, for the first time, American-supplied (and [long-awaited](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/22/america-says-it-will-send-long-range-missiles-to-ukraine)) ATACMS missiles against an important Russian air base, reportedly doing severe damage to several helicopters.

The battle’s front lines are unlikely to move dramatically in the weeks ahead, but a combination of inept Russian offensives and fresh Ukrainian strikes could cause Russia’s human and material losses to spike dramatically.

### A pulse check on China’s property sector

Small moves in [home prices](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/10/12/amid-turmoil-in-chinas-property-market-the-public-seethes) are a big deal in China these days. For young people, who are prospective owners, a fall is a relief, especially after years of soaring prices. But for homeowners a drop means that their biggest investment is losing value. Policymakers, too, are rooting for higher prices rather than lower ones. That is because problems in the housing sector have deepened, even as China’s economic outlook has begun stabilising after several months of gloomy data. An increase in prices, even if small, would be evidence that efforts to revive the beleaguered sector are working.

On Thursday September data for house prices in China’s 70 largest cities will be published; in August prices fell in 66 of them, the highest number since 2014. Technocrats in Beijing hope that prices fell in fewer cities last month. A reversal in the house-prices slump would suggest China’s incipient economic revival has staying power.

### Powell’s chance to steer markets

It has been nearly three months since the Federal Reserve last raised interest rates. When Jerome Powell, chairman of the Fed, speaks on Thursday, he may hint at whether this pause will continue. Addressing a luncheon at the Economic Club of New York, Mr Powell will probably try to strike a balance between asserting that inflation remains a threat and arguing that interest rates may be high enough to contain it.

The [American economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/23/americas-astonishing-economic-growth-goes-up-another-gear) still appears resilient. Figures released this week for both retail sales and industrial output were strong. The danger is that such strength fuels inflation. At the same time, investors have priced in the possibility that the Fed will keep rates higher for longer than previously expected, which is why bond yields have recently jumped. If Mr Powell suggests that the market has been doing the Fed’s work for it, that may mean that he sees little need for additional rate hikes.

### Paris’s international art show opens

On Thursday Paris+, an art fair put on by Art Basel, a long-standing Swiss event, opens in the French capital. The fair shines a spotlight on the city, whose cultural sector is booming ahead of [the Olympics in 2024](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/13/cricket-will-make-the-olympics-bigger-and-better). Important international art galleries, including Hauser & Wirth, have recently set up shop in the city, and private foundations and museums are launching eye-catching shows. A retrospective of Mark Rothko, an American painter, opened on Wednesday at Fondation Louis Vuitton.

Last year 40,000 visitors came to Paris+. Even more are expected this time. But unease is cutting through the art-buying world. On Wednesday eight French airports closed owing to bomb threats. Police in European capitals, including Paris and London, are on high alert for terrorist attacks as the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies and threatens to spread. Even the art world is not immune to the reality of current events.
