Israel continued attacking **Gaza** as the holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/10/the-bloodshed-in-gaza-is-set-to-rage-through-ramadan) began. The **Israel Defence Forces** reportedly struck a site on Saturday where Marwan Issa—a leader of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s armed wing—may have been hiding, and is trying to confirm whether he was killed. Meanwhile, the departure of the first ship carrying humanitarian aid from Cyprus to Gaza was delayed.

**President Joe Biden** proposed a $7.3trn budget for the coming fiscal year. The plan proposes lower costs of child care and housing, among other things. That would be funded by higher taxes on corporations and the rich. But [Mr Biden’s](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/trump-biden-polls) proposal will likely not pass the House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans.

Following his visit to Mar-a-Lago last week, **Viktor Orban**, Hungary’s autocratic prime minister, told Hungarian state media that, as president, **Donald Trump** would “not give a single penny” in support of Ukraine “therefore the war will end”. Mr Trump’s wing of the Republican party is [increasingly resistant](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/14/house-republicans-fear-trump-too-much-to-aid-ukraine) to funding Ukraine, as is Mr Orban, who until last month [held up European efforts](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/01/europe-finds-eu50bn-for-ukraine-and-a-way-around-viktor-orban) to send more aid.

**France** suffered a series of **cyber-attacks** of “unprecedented” intensity, according to the prime minister’s office. The source of the attacks, which targeted several government departments and “many ministerial services”, is unconfirmed. A few hacker groups claimed responsibility on Telegram, a messaging service, including a pro-Russian group called Anonymous Sudan.

The price of **bitcoin** exceeded $71,000, an all-time high. The [cryptocurrency](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/06/bitcoins-price-is-surging-what-happens-next) has rallied for five consecutive days and gained more than 60% since the start of the year. The surge has been driven by a wave of capital flowing into newly-approved bitcoin exchange-trading funds. British regulators said on Monday that they would allow the creation of similar crypto-related securities.

**India** implemented the Citizenship Amendment Act, a controversial law which initially [passed in 2019](https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/12/12/indias-new-citizenship-law-outrages-muslims), weeks before a general election. It allows immigrants from three countries—Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan—quicker access to citizenship. But while it accepts adherents of six religions from those countries, it does not include Muslims. That challenges the secularism enshrined in India’s constitution and advances the government’s [Hindu-nationalist](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/03/07/what-is-hindutva-the-ideology-of-indias-ruling-party) priorities.

Britain’s Office for National Statistics added **vinyl records** to the inflation basket, which is intended to reflect [consumers’s spending habits](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/23/how-superstars-and-heritage-acts-hijacked-the-vinyl-revival). Records were taken out of the basket in 1992, but have become more popular in Britain in recent years. Other additions include air fryers and edible sunflower seeds. Hand sanitizers and hot rotisserie cooked chicken were removed.

### The enduring problem of Fukushima

In August TEPCO, a Japanese electricity company, started releasing [wastewater](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/07/13/asia-is-rowing-about-fukushima-nuclear-wastewater) from its Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean. The plant’s disastrous meltdown in 2011 still casts a long shadow: though the treated wastewater is now barely radioactive, the decision was widely unpopular.

The UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency sanctioned the plan in the summer. On Tuesday Rafael Grossi, the agency’s head, will visit Japan again to review the project. After his three-day visit he is likely to reassure government officials and locals that no environmental damage has been caused. Last week IAEA experts reported that levels of radioactivity in the water remain “far below the operational limit”.

The real challenge, though, is decommissioning the power plant, which still holds around 880 tonnes of radioactive fuel-debris in its crippled reactors. In January TEPCO delayed its clean-up plan—meant to start in 2021—for the third time. Many worry that the promised completion deadline of 2051 now looks far-fetched.

### America’s slowly slowing inflation

The headline figures may look worrying. Data due on Tuesday are expected to show that consumer prices in America rose by 0.4% month on month in February, more than in January. A steady increase in petrol prices was probably mainly responsible. But what really matters is underlying inflationary momentum, revealed by core prices, which strip out energy and food costs. These are forecast to have risen by about 0.3% month on month, a slight deceleration from January.

By itself, a small slowdown in inflation will not move the needle for markets. But it is likely to reinforce investors’ belief that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in June. Last week Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, said he was “not far” from having the [confidence](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/02/16/american-consumers-are-finally-cheering-up) to cut rates. A benign inflation report would move him a little bit closer.

### Biden hosts Poland’s divided leaders

Poland joined NATO a quarter of a century ago. That membership now seems more important than ever. Poles watched in horror as Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which is not a member, in 2022. In a recent poll almost half of respondents said they expected Russia to attack their country in the next few years.

Last year Poland raised [defence spending](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/02/beefing-up-polands-armed-forces) to 4% of GDP—twice the target for NATO members. President Joe Biden will probably laud that commitment when he hosts Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, and its [new prime minister](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/14/donald-tusk-must-undo-years-of-populist-subversion-in-poland), Donald Tusk, at the White House on Tuesday. The joint invitation is symbolic: the two come from [bitterly opposed parties](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/01/30/what-on-earth-is-happening-in-poland). Mr Duda said it shows the strength of the Polish-American relationship “regardless of who rules in both countries.”

But some Republicans are wavering on their country’s commitment to defending eastern European allies. Poles will be hoping that America’s support will hold whoever wins November’s presidential election.

### Argentines’ patience is wearing thin

In January Argentina’s annual inflation rate was a staggering 254.2%, the highest since 1991. Yet the country also recorded its first fiscal surplus in nearly 12 years. For some, that second part is evidence enough that [President Javier Milei’s](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/10/19/can-argentinas-next-president-fix-the-economy-dont-count-on-it) pursuit of fiscal balance—including a 54% devaluation of the peso and the end of energy and transport subsidies—is gradually working. For others, though, the economic pill is too bitter to swallow.

They will get a sense of how long they must keep taking Mr Milei’s medicine on Tuesday, when inflation data for February are due. The president predicts a lower monthly rate of 15% (January’s was 20.6%). But that is still very high. And Mr Milei admits that “it will take some time” before the country sees the benefits of his reforms. But with 57.4% of Argentines now below the poverty line—the most in two decades—many do not feel they can wait.

### Gabriel García Márquez’s last novel

Gabriel García Márquez—a Colombian Nobel-prizewinning novelist who [died](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2014/04/26/the-magician-in-his-labyrinth) in 2014—once said memory was his primary source of material. That may explain why, suffering from dementia towards the end of his life, he insisted that his final novella should never be published.

His sons eventually [decided otherwise](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/03/06/gabriel-garcia-marquezs-novella-was-published-against-his-wishes). “Until August” will be unveiled on Tuesday, in the run-up to the tenth anniversary of the author’s death. With any such “lost” work, the question arises of whether it should have been found again. Márquez’s adoring public will decide for themselves, but many early reviews of this slight book have been mixed at best. The master of magical realism here conjured a plot that seems to be a variation on those in low-grade erotic fiction: a married woman on an annual pilgrimage takes a different lover each year. It’s possible that, even in his sadly diminished state, Márquez saw his final book with clearer eyes than his children chose to.
