## The world in brief

### December 22, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Israel’s armed forces** said they had killed “hundreds” of Hamas fighters, as they pushed farther into [Gaza city](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/14/israels-current-large-scale-operation-is-the-last-one-in-gaza) in an attempt to push Hamas out of the capital. Earlier, the army claimed to have found a **command centre** of the Palestinian militia that sits in the middle of the network of tunnels used to move soldiers, weapons and other supplies. According to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, the Palestinian death toll has now passed 20,000. Truce negotiations in Egypt continued for a second day.

**Angola** quit **OPEC** after 16 years of membership to protest against the oil cartel’s leaders capping production to [prop up prices](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/03/oil-prices-fall-defying-suggestions-of-a-100-barrel). Diamantino Azevedo, Angola’s minerals minister, said his country had not been “deemed relevant” in the organisation, which now has [12 members](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/29/an-unruly-opec-is-causing-problems-for-russia-and-saudi-arabia). Oil prices slipped on the news of the break-up. But Angola’s exit is not expected to have much further effect on prices—its production is already close to its capacity.

General Charles Brown, chairman of the **US Joint Chiefs of Staff**, spoke with his **Chinese** counterpart, General Liu Zhenli, marking an unfreezing of high-level military relations. China severed such contacts in 2022 after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of America’s House of Representatives, visited [Taiwan](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/11/06/invading-taiwan-would-be-a-logistical-minefield-for-china), which China claims as its territory. Last month the presidents, Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, agreed to resume communications.

At least 15 people were killed and dozens injured in a **shooting** at a university in central **Prague**. Czech police said that the gunman, a student, had been “eliminated”. Gun crime is rare in the Czech Republic, which is the only country in Europe where citizens have a constitutional right to bear arms—though owners must pass a test.

**Britain and Switzerland** have signed a deal to improve each country’s financial firms’ access to the other’s market. Described by Jeremy Hunt, Britain’s finance minister, as a “global first”, the “Bern Financial Services Agreement” took two years to hammer out. It is based on the [mutual recognition](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/01/05/assembling-a-better-british-relationship-with-europe) of rules and supervisors, to ease regulatory burdens.

**Pakistani police** fired tear-gas and water-cannons and made dozens of arrests in Islamabad to break up a demonstration predominantly of women who had marched for weeks from their province, **Balochistan**. They were protesting about the disappearances of loved ones they claimed had been detained by the intelligence services. The march began after a detainee died in police custody.

**Rudy Giuliani** filed for bankruptcy after being ordered to pay $148m for defaming two poll workers in Georgia, whom he had falsely accused of fraud during the 2020 election. In his filing Mr Giuliani, Donald Trump’s former lawyer, reported up to $500m in liabilities and up to $10m in assets. Mr Giuliani faces several other [lawsuits for conspiracy-peddling](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/02/17/lawsuits-arrive-for-networks-and-lawyers-who-backed-donald-trump), including one by Smartmatic, a voting-technology firm.

### 2023 in review: Model embryos are increasingly realistic

*This week we are looking back on 2023. Today, science and technology*

The traditional way to make an embryo requires combining a sperm cell and an egg (often after combining food and alcohol). But recently scientists have found that stem cells can make respectable imitations.

With a little encouragement, stem cells form embryo-like structures called [“embryoids”](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/11/01/lab-grown-models-of-embryos-increasingly-resemble-the-real-thing), which are helpful for studying embryology and pregnancy. They are usually not subject to the same regulation as the real embryos they simulate, which after all have the potential to turn into a human being. Using human embryoids could allow researchers to understand developmental heart defects, diseases like spina bifida, or how to prevent pregnancy loss.

But as embryoids become more lifelike, they pose more of an ethical quandary. When should they be treated to the same protections as real embryos? Scientists are working on an answer to that question, which they think is increasingly pressing: embryoids have already been used to produce (short-lived) pregnancies in monkeys.

### 2023 in review: This ancient whale was really, really big

Everyone knows that the dinosaurs had heft: *Tyrannosaurus rex* grew up to 12 metres (half the length of a tennis court); the herbivore *Patagotitan mayorum* may have clocked in at 37 metres and 69 tonnes. But they appear dwarfed by an animal whose discovery was published in *Nature*, a journal, this summer.

Giovanni Bianucci, a palaeontologist at the University of Pisa, and his team recovered bones from the Ica Valley in Peru that indicate that a truly [enormous marine mammal](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/08/02/an-ancient-whale-like-animal-may-be-the-biggest-to-have-ever-lived) may have existed around 40m years ago. They estimate that the creature, *Perucetus colossus*, could have weighed up to 340 tonnes. (Today’s blue whale, previously thought the most massive animal to have ever lived, weighs up to about 190 tonnes.) That figure is uncertain, as only an incomplete skeleton was found. Just why *P. colossus* might have gotten so big is also a mystery. And though they reckon it swam in shallow, fertile waters, researchers do not know what the extinct behemoth ate.

### 2023 in review: The diversity of human genomes

This year marked the 20th anniversary of the publication of the results from “the Human Genome Project”. That was a landmark in biology—and [a misnomer](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/05/10/the-human-genome-was-always-a-misnomer). There is no such thing as “the” human genome; instead each of the planet’s 8bn humans has slightly different DNA.

Capturing that diversity required a new repository, the details of which were first published in May. “The Human Pangenome Project” includes 47 “reference” genomes, taken from individuals on four continents (Africa, both of the Americas, and Asia). That does a far better job of reflecting the genetic diversity of *Homo sapiens* than any one genome could. Although two people picked at random will share around 99.6% of their DNA, the differences contained in the remaining 0.4% are important. They account for everything from food tolerance to proneness to particular diseases. Increasing the set of reference genomes should help scientists better understand genetic variation, and how helpful or harmful it can be.

### 2023 in review: A long-awaited deal on fossil fuels

In December world leaders at COP28, the UN’s [climate summit](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/12/13/climate-talks-at-last-lead-to-a-deal-on-cutting-fossil-fuel-use) in Dubai, finally reached an agreement to limit fossil-fuel use. Remarkably, the deal—which took three decades of international climate diplomacy to achieve—was forged in one of the planet’s largest petrostates, the United Arab Emirates.

All 198 parties at the conference promised to “transition away” from using fossil fuels, the main source of the greenhouse-gas emissions responsible for global warming, in their energy systems. Although it is a rare success for multilateralism, the commitment will not do nearly enough to keep global temperature rise under the 1.5°C goal specified in the Paris agreement (or even the less ambitious 2°C target). The world is already about 1.2°C warmer than before the industrial revolution, and UN treaties are toothless. The hope, though, is that it will set the direction of travel and, crucially, convince governments and businesses that fossil fuels are no longer the solid investments they once were.
