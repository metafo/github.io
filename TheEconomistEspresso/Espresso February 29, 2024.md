## The world in brief

### February 29, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Ursula von der Leyen**, the president of the European Commission, said that the EU should use windfall [profits](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/20/why-the-eu-will-not-seize-russian-state-assets-to-rebuild-ukraine) from **Russian** central-bank assets in Western accounts to procure weapons for Ukraine. It is the first time the EU has linked the use of frozen Russian assets to arm Ukraine. More than €200bn ($216bn) of Russian assets are frozen in the bloc. America wants Europe to confiscate Russian assets, but EU countries are reluctant owing to concerns about Russian retaliation, especially potential cyberattacks. The plan must be agreed unanimously by all 27 member states.

The **Supreme Court** agreed to decide whether Donald Trump is [immune from prosecution](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/07/a-court-rejects-donald-trumps-claim-to-absolute-immunity) in his federal election-interference case. Mr Trump’s claim—that he cannot be tried for duties he carried out while in office—has been rejected by two lower courts. His appeals [have already delayed](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/22/why-those-who-wish-to-see-trump-jailed-soon-will-be-disappointed) the trial, which was due to start on March 4th. The Supreme Court scheduled arguments for the week of April 22nd.

**Apple** pulled the plug on its attempt to build an electric car, according to widespread reports. The project, one of the [tech giant’s](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/24/what-could-bring-apple-down) more quixotic, had been running for a decade and received billions in investment. Nonetheless, a commercially available, fully autonomous vehicle was thought to be years away. Investors—and Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla—cheered the news.

**Mitch McConnell** will step down in November as the Republican leader in America’s Senate, a role he has held longer than anyone of either party. The 82-year-old will serve out his term, which ends in January 2027. A firm supporter of Ukraine, his legacy will be shaped by his ability to overcome Republican opposition to further aiding the country.

**Alexei Navalny**, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader who [died](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/22/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity) in a penal colony on February 16th, will be buried in **Moscow** on Friday, according to his team. A spokesperson said the authorities had prevented them from holding the funeral on Thursday, when **Vladimir Putin** is scheduled to give a state-of-the-nation address to Russia’s parliament.

**Bitcoin** prices rose to their highest level in more than two years, as institutional investors continued to pour money into the newly-approved exchange-traded funds. Almost $7bn has flowed into [bitcoin](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/18/why-bitcoin-is-up-by-almost-150-this-year) **ETFs** since their approval in January. In April the incentives made available to miners who verify bitcoin transactions are scheduled to halve; the expected reduction in supply is also pushing up prices.

### A doctors’ strike in South Korea

Around 9,000 trainee and junior doctors in South Korea have been on strike since early last week. They are protesting against the government’s plan to increase an annual quota for medical-student enrolment from 3,000 to 5,000.

Doctors argue that the large number of new students will harm medical education. Yet South Korea is in desperate need of more medical students. It has a shortage of doctors in areas such as paediatrics, and one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. Some self-employed doctors have received bumper pay packets owing to the shortage.

Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea’s president, has vowed to stand firm, promising to suspend medical licences unless doctors return to work by Thursday. Doctors say they will not give up either. During the strike, surgeries have been cancelled. A woman died after seven hospitals turned away her ambulance because they are short of staff and beds.

### The Australian-Philippine alliance strengthens

On Thursday Ferdinand Marcos, president of the Philippines, addresses a joint session of both houses of Australia’s Parliament. The invitation is a rare honour, signifying the importance the countries attach to their strategic partnership, which was formed in Manila in September. In particular, Australia and the Philippines share an interest in standing up to [China in the South China Sea](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/02/10/how-the-nine-dash-line-fuels-tensions-in-the-south-china-sea).

Philippine forces are too weak to deter the Chinese from advancing far into the disputed areas of the South China Sea. But they have found an ally in Australia which, for generations, has endeavoured to keep adversaries at bay as far as possible from its own shores. Last November warships and warplanes from Australia and the Philippines began jointly patrolling the disputed waters. Chinese forces watched closely, but left them alone. China is mindful, no doubt, that both countries are [increasingly important allies](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/21/the-philippines-proximity-to-taiwan-makes-it-central-to-western-strategy) of [America](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/23/australia-is-becoming-americas-military-launch-pad-into-asia).

### Putin lauds the state of Russia

On Thursday President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to give a state-of-the-nation address to Russia’s parliament. He is likely to sound upbeat. Russian forces are [slowly making progress](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/02/21/is-ukraine-losing-the-war-against-russia) in Ukraine. On February 17th they took Avdiivka, a small eastern town, following a months-long siege. At home, the economy is growing rapidly because of the stimulus from the Kremlin’s financing of the war. And the recent death in a Siberian penal colony of [Alexei Navalny](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/22/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity), Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, removes a thorn from the president’s side. Mr Putin is certain to win a blatantly unfair presidential election next month.

In the long term, however, the Kremlin will struggle to maintain living standards while funding its war. Public discontent may grow. After Navalny’s death, many Russians left flowers at memorials for victims of political repression. An anti-war movement led by the female relatives of soldiers is [gaining traction](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/19/vladimir-putin-has-been-fighting-not-just-ukraine-but-his-own-people). Still, Mr Putin will only double down on his war, and his campaign of repression of those who speak out against it.

### Does a leap day pay?

In the Gregorian calendar Thursday is a “leap day”, added almost every four years because a solar year is a little longer than 365 days. Ever-youthful [leap-day babies](https://www.economist.com/1843/2021/06/08/dont-save-the-date-tokyo-2020-isnt-the-only-event-to-take-place-in-the-wrong-year) can celebrate their rare birthdays by taking advantage of offers that companies make just for them, from free beer to a Caribbean cruise.

Thankfully, others benefit, too. Krispy Kreme gives free doughnuts to “leapies”, and offers leap-day discounts to everyone else. The extra working day will boost February’s numbers for businesses and economies. For instance, KPMG, an accountancy firm, estimates that the additional day will add A$6.6bn ($4.3bn) to Australia’s economy, helping it to avoid a recession.

In 2016 Zappos, an American shoe seller, gave staff a paid day off and lobbied for February 29th to become a public holiday. In general hourly-paid workers get their usual rate on a leap day. But firms usually don’t compensate salaried staff for their extra toil. Cheap doughnuts are the least they deserve.

### An extraordinary survival story

On March 4th 1973 Maurice and Maralyn Bailey’s [boat crashed](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/02/27/explaining-history-through-numerical-groupings-is-in-vogue) into a 40-foot sperm whale in the Pacific Ocean. For the next 118 days the British couple drifted on a tiny inflatable life-raft. They survived by drinking rainwater and catching turtles, fish, birds and sharks. A Korean tuna-fishing ship rescued them. In “Maurice and Maralyn”, a riveting book published in Britain on Thursday, Sophie Elmhirst (an occasional contributor to *1843*, *The Economist*’s sister magazine) retells the survival story.

The couple dreamed of becoming explorers, free “to go wherever they liked, whenever they liked”. That impulse to spurn conventional life is widespread today, when many workers are “quiet quitting”. Almost 60% of workers across the world say that their jobs do not interest them. But, despite the adventure, the book suggests that it was the strength of the couple’s relationship that was truly extraordinary.
