## The world in brief

### November 4, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Antony Blinken**, America’s secretary of state, urged **Israel** to implement a series of humanitarian pauses while meeting with top government officials in Tel Aviv. **Binyamin Netanyahu**, Israel’s prime minister, said that any ceasefire was conditional on Hamas releasing hostages*.* Meanwhile Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said 15 Palestinians were killed and 60 injured by an Israeli strike on an ambulance convoy carrying wounded people. Israel’s army confirmed the attack, claiming that one ambulance was “being used by a Hamas terrorist cell”. A Hamas spokesperson responded that the allegations were “baseless”.

American **job growth** slowed in October; employers added 150,000 jobs last month, down from 297,000 in September and fewer than expected. Hourly earnings rose just 0.2% in month-on-month terms, the slowest in almost two years. America’s stock market rallied on the news—slow wage growth should reduce price pressures.

**Russia** launched its biggest drone strike on **Ukraine** in weeks, targeting sites across the country and hitting a military facility in the western region of Ivano-Frankivsk. Ukraine’s air force said it had shot down 24 of the 40 drones. Meanwhile a Kremlin spokesman said that the conflict had “not reached a stalemate”, rejecting [comments made](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/01/ukraines-commander-in-chief-on-the-breakthrough-he-needs-to-beat-russia) to *The Economist* by Ukraine’s top general, Valery Zaluzhny.

**America** announced $425m in military aid for **Ukraine**. The relatively small figure uses the last of an $18bn fund authorised by Congress; it also includes $125m worth of weapons that Joe Biden can transfer from existing stockpiles. Mr Biden wants Congress to pass a $106bn security package for Ukraine and Israel, plus other areas. Many Republicans [oppose](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/26/the-republican-party-no-longer-believes-america-is-the-essential-nation) further aiding Ukraine.

At least 119 people were killed and 100 injured after an earthquake in **Nepal**, according to local officials. The epicentre of the 5.6-magnitude tremor was 42km south of Jumla, a town in the west of the country. Its effects could be felt as far away as Delhi, India, almost 500km away.

**Sam Bankman-Fried** was [convicted](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/03/sam-bankman-frieds-downfall-is-complete) of defrauding customers of **FTX**, his failed crypto exchange. A federal jury in New York found him guilty on all seven counts, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money-laundering. Mr Bankman-Fried faces a maximum of 110 years in prison. He is due to be sentenced in March.

**Colombia** said it would begin culling the [hippos](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/10/30/pablo-escobars-hippos-lead-a-charge-for-animal-rights) which descended from pets kept by Pablo Escobar, a billionaire drug lord. Mr Escobar kept the imported hippos in his private zoo. But after the kingpin was killed in 1993 they began to roam free, thriving in the savanna climate of north-west Colombia. Their descendants, which number around 150, were classed as an invasive species last year.

### Australia’s prime minister visits China

Fresh from talks with Joe Biden in America, Anthony Albanese, Australia’s centre-left prime minister, jets to China on Saturday to meet its leader, Xi Jinping. He is the first Australian leader to visit since 2016—a sign of warming relations.

The trip follows a tumultuous few years. China hit Australia with A$24bn-worth ($16bn) of trade bans and tariffs in 2020 after a previous Australian government called for an inquiry into the origins of the covid pandemic. But Australia stood firm and since January China has [lifted most of its bans](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/23/australia-has-faced-down-chinas-trade-bans-and-emerged-stronger).

Mr Xi will now press for concessions. He wants Australia to support its bid to join[ the CPTPP](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/02/19/asias-premier-trade-pact-needs-stronger-foundations), a free-trade pact, and to loosen national-security restrictions on foreign investment. Mr Albanese has already said he will not overturn the controversial lease of a port in Darwin to a Chinese company, Landbridge. Still, he insists he is “clear-eyed” about China’s charm offensive.

### An incendiary rally in Italy

On the topic of Israel’s war with Hamas, Italy is stepping gingerly. It has a Muslim population of more than 2m and troops in six Muslim countries, including Lebanon. But, unlike some other [EU countries](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/the-eus-response-to-the-crisis-in-israel-exposes-its-limits), Italy did not back the UN resolution calling for a humanitarian truce in Gaza.

The [last thing](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/24/italys-hard-right-government-is-starting-to-look-more-radical) Giorgia Meloni’s government needs is to be seen promoting a provocative demonstration. Yet her deputy, Matteo Salvini of the right-populist Northern League, will on Saturday host an event in Milan to endorse Western values and contest “Islamist fanaticism”.

That day Italy also honours its armed forces. The defence minister had ordered the celebrations this year to be low-key. Maurizio Fioravanti, a retired general who once commanded Italy’s special forces, has called Mr Salvini’s rally “almost crazy”. But the League leader’s move is consistent with his emerging strategy of harrying Ms Meloni from the right. And he has never shrunk from playing with fire.

### African trade: not much of AGOA

An air of [disappointment](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/02/09/taking-stock-of-americas-flagship-trade-programme-for-africa) surrounds the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a trade policy that offers countries in sub-Saharan Africa duty-free access to American markets for thousands of products. Eligible countries now account for a smaller share of American imports than they did in 2000, when the act was first passed.

Trade officials at the annual AGOA forum, which [closes](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/02/america-suspends-duty-free-access-to-four-african-countries) on Saturday in Johannesburg, can point to one modest success: the fledgling garment industry, in which the scheme has helped create jobs. Still, American imports of textiles and apparel from AGOA’s beneficiaries have fallen by 17% in the first eight months of 2023, compared with the same period last year. Uncertainty may be part of the reason—the act expires in 2025. In America, there is bipartisan support for renewal, but Congress is too distracted by domestic squabbles to legislate. Each day of delay puts more African jobs at risk.

### A reckoning for American horseracing

American horseracing has been [under a cloud](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/05/is-horse-racing-in-america-on-its-last-legs) for years. Recently two leading trainers, Jason Servis and Jorge Navarro, admitted running widespread horse-doping programmes. Now, for the first time, the Breeders’ Cup meeting, which concludes on Saturday at Santa Anita Park in California, will be conducted under the jurisdiction of a federal body, the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority.

HISA hopes that by introducing country-wide standards, it can end the patchwork of state-level regulations that made it easy to cheat. It wants to improve animal welfare, too. In 2019, several dozen horses died at Santa Anita Park. But the new body has not been welcomed by everyone. Legislation supported by the North American Association of Racetrack Veterinarians, introduced in Congress in September, seeks to return more authority to the states. Even if the Breeders’ Cup meeting is clean and fatality-free, it is unlikely to settle the argument of how racing should be regulated.

### Weekend profile: Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers

Over the past six weeks Shawn Fain, the bespectacled, often smiling 55-year-old leader of the United Auto Workers union, oversaw an unprecedented [strike](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/24/will-the-auto-workers-strike-jeopardise-joe-bidens-manufacturing-boom) against the country’s “Big Three” carmakers. From September 15th to October 30th, workers at the most profitable plants run by Ford, General Motors and Stellantis parked themselves on picket lines. (Stellantis’s biggest shareholder part-owns *The Economist’s* parent company.) The firms buckled. Under provisional deals workers will receive big pay increases—north of 30% for longtime employees.

Mr Fain has long been a committed union member. In 2007 he was working as an electrician for Chrysler in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana when the firm proposed reducing the pay of future workers owing to the financial crisis. Mr Fain sent a letter to the leadership of the United Auto Workers, the union he joined in 1994. If it accepted the deal, he wrote, “you might as well get a gun and shoot yourself in the head”. His local chapter voted to reject the agreement; the UAW took it.

Mr Fain could have remained a local firebrand. But this spring the UAW held its first-ever direct election. It wanted to move past a corruption scandal which, by 2022, saw 17 of its top brass convicted. Most had embezzling union money. One particularly crooked official stole $2m to buy guns, cars and cocaine.

Mr Fain got the gig. Executive salaries had shot up as car sales soared during the pandemic, and his “fed up” campaign message resonated with workers. After winning in March he promptly set a new tone, railing against the “billionaire class” and declining to shake hands, as is customary, with the Big Three bosses when contract negotiations kicked off in July.

The strike was backed by politicians on both sides of the aisle who were looking to pick up working-class votes. In September Joe Biden became the first sitting president to [appear](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/27/joe-biden-may-come-to-regret-his-claim-to-be-pro-union) on a picket line. Mr Fain, however, is predictably uninterested in giving the powerful any easy wins. He has yet to endorse a presidential candidate. But Donald Trump, Mr Fain has pointed out, has a spotty record on supporting unions. Not to mention, “he’s part of the billionaire class”.
