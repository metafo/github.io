Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



The UN General Assembly passed a resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. More than 150 member states voted for the non-binding resolution; ten, including America, voted against. Earlier Joe Biden said that global support for **Israel’s** “indiscriminate bombing” in **Gaza** is waning, and that Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, “doesn’t want a two-state solution”. Mr Netanyahu separately admitted that Israel and America do not agree over how Gaza will be governed [after the war](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/10/israel-has-just-a-few-weeks-left-to-destroy-hamas). Some 85% of Gaza’s population—1.9m people—have been displaced and half its people are starving.

In a critical victory for **Rishi Sunak**, **Britain’s** prime minister, the House of Commons [passed](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/12/britains-parliament-should-kill-rishi-sunaks-rwanda-bill) the Safety of Rwanda bill despite a number of his party’s MPs abstaining. Courts have [blocked](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/12/07/the-british-conservatives-crisis-over-rwanda-is-a-rerun-of-brexit) Mr Sunak’s attempt to deport asylum-seekers who arrive in Britain on small boats to Rwanda, deeming it unsafe. The bill, declaring otherwise, had critics across the governing Conservative Party. It will face further votes in 2024.

**America**’s annual inflation rate was 3.1% in November, down slightly from 3.2% in October, partly because of falling fuel costs. The core measure, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, remained at 4%. At its meeting on Wednesday the Federal Reserve is expected to [hold interest rates](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/23/how-will-americas-economy-fare-in-2024-dont-ask-a-forecaster) at their current level.

The presidency of the **COP28 summit** in Dubai began preparing another final agreement. An earlier draft drew condemnation saying that fossil fuels should be “limited” rather than “phased out”. Over 100 countries have advocated a stronger wording, but they face opposition from oil-exporting nations. All 198 countries attending must agree to the deal.

Prosecutors in **Germany** accused 27 people of conspiring to violently overthrow the government. Some were arrested last December in a federal raid that brought to light the far-right [plot](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/07/german-police-arrest-two-dozen-alleged-conspirators-in-a-hare-brained-plot-to-overthrow-the-government) to install “Prince” Heinrich XIII of Reuss as the country’s leader. Some of the suspects are accused of being members of the Reichsbürger, an extremist group that rejects the legitimacy of the federal republic.

**Kyivstar**, Ukraine’s main mobile network, was hit by a crippling cyber attack, leaving customers without phone or internet access. Ukrainian officials said that air raid sirens across the Kyiv region were disrupted by the hack, with cash machines and banks also affected. Ukraine’s security services opened an investigation into the attack, which it believes may have been launched by [Russian hackers](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/03/29/russian-hackers-are-preparing-for-a-new-campaign-in-ukraine).

**Turkey**’s football federation suspended all leagues after violence broke out on Monday night at a match between Ankaragucu and Rizespor. Ankaragucu’s president, Faruk Koca, ran onto the pitch and punched the referee immediately after the match had finished. The opposing team had scored an equaliser in extra time. Turkey’s president, **Recep Tayyip Erdogan**, a keen football fan, condemned the attack.

### COP28’s opaque endgame

On Sunday Sultan Al Jaber—the president of [COP28,](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/16/three-climate-fights-will-dominate-cop28) the UN climate summit taking place in Dubai—suggested delegates needed “to move much, much, much faster”. His chivvying did not work. As Wednesday dawns, talks that were meant to have finished almost a full day previously will not have concluded. There is little indication of when an agreement might be reached, or what it could look like.

Negotiations are stuck over what promises should be made on fossil fuels. For a while it looked as if the final agreement might commit countries to mostly stopping both producing and consuming oil, coal and gas (albeit with serious caveats). But some countries, mostly oil producers, attempted to weaken the language, provoking uproar from others including America, the European Union and [small island states](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/11/26/many-small-islands-have-no-room-for-manoeuvre-at-cop28). Opposite outcomes now loom: either the summit makes history, or it falls apart entirely.

### Republicans go after the Biden family

As early as Wednesday Republicans in the House of Representatives will vote to formalise their impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden. Three House committees have been [investigating](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/11/hunter-bidens-woes-and-a-new-impeachment-saga-will-go-on-and-on) the president since September, with little to show for it. According to James Comer, the chairman of the House Oversight committee, a formal inquiry would strengthen its hand in court against “anyone who refuses” a subpoena.

That is a reference to Hunter Biden, the president’s son. In November Mr Comer’s committee issued a subpoena to Hunter, demanding he testify at a closed-door deposition. Hunter countered with an offer to appear at a public hearing, which Republicans rejected. They hope to show that the president profited from his son’s foreign business dealings. Hunter was [recently charged](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/12/13/what-are-the-allegations-against-hunter-biden) with failing to pay $1.4m in taxes (a claim his lawyer suggested was politically motivated) and may face further investigation. Still, Mr Comer is far from building a case against what he has called the “Biden crime family”.

### The EU’s difficult meetings

A tense series of meetings start in Brussels on Wednesday with a summit featuring leaders from the EU and Western Balkans. The regular gathering was long an exercise in justifying why countries including Serbia and North Macedonia were making little progress in their two-decade quest to join the bloc. But prospects for enlargement [have improved](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/28/the-eu-is-finally-rebooting-the-enlargement-machine) since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war has made members keener to bring its neighbours into the club to fend off Russian interference.

That enthusiasm will be tested again on Thursday and Friday when EU leaders meet for their last summit of the year. Diplomats from the bloc’s 27 members had hoped to open formal negotiations over Ukraine’s accession, and to sign off on a €50bn ($54bn) aid package for the country over four years. But both are being [held up](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/30/how-a-sombre-mood-gripped-europe) by Viktor Orban, Hungary’s autocratic prime minister, partly because of his enduring willingness to appreciate the Kremlin’s point of view.

### Poland’s new government

The handover of power has been no less bitter than the years of [political brawling](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/05/after-a-brutal-campaign-poland-gets-ready-to-vote) that preceded it. After a disappointing result in an [election](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/17/poland-shows-that-populists-can-be-beaten) in October, Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party lost a vote of confidence on Monday. Parliament then backed Donald Tusk of the Civic Coalition as prime minister. The leader of PiS, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, accused Mr Tusk of being a “German agent”—an insinuation that stems from his [warm relations](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/15/poland-gives-pro-european-liberals-a-big-win) with European leaders.

Mr Tusk, who will be sworn into office on Wednesday, has promised to mend Poland’s [relations with the EU](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/30/poland-is-being-given-an-opportunity-to-matter-in-europe) after years of disquiet over PiS’s [undermining of the rule of law](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/16/polands-rule-of-law-conflict-with-the-eu-is-coming-to-a-head). By Thursday he will be in Brussels for a leaders’ summit. As a former president of the European Council he can expect a warm welcome. But to restore his country to the bloc’s good graces (and unlock billions of euros in funds) he will need to depoliticise Poland’s courts and media.

### Big data and dementia

The UK Biobank, a British repository of medical data, holds a conference in London on Wednesday. Experts will talk about the role of genomics in predicting disease, as well as the latest research on [dementia](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/12/03/what-to-read-about-dementia). Around 55m people worldwide have the [condition](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/01/11/dementia-will-affect-more-than-150m-people-worldwide-by-2050). Yet up to 40% of cases could be prevented or delayed by tackling environmental and behavioural factors that heighten the risk of developing dementia. Biological changes begin many years before noticeable symptoms prompt a visit to the doctor.

The Biobank recently released its largest genomic dataset yet for global researchers to analyse. It includes whole genome sequences from half a million volunteers, as well as information from the past two decades on their lifestyle and health. Such comprehensive data could improve understanding of conditions like dementia. It should also enable detailed analyses of how genes interact with the environment—and contribute to the risk of future disease.
