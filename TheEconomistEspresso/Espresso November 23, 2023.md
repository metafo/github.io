**Israeli** [hostages](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/22/israel-strikes-a-hostage-deal-but-promises-the-gaza-war-isnt-over) will not be released by **Hamas** until Friday at the earliest, according to Binyamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser. The release of 50 hostages is part of a deal that includes a four-day pause in fighting; earlier a spokesperson for Hamas had said that the truce was expected to begin on Thursday morning. Under the agreement, Israel is also expected to free around 150 Palestinian prisoners and to allow around 300 aid trucks to enter [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/19/what-happens-to-gaza-after-the-war) from Egypt each day.

Party for Freedom, a far-right party led by [Geert Wilders](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/07/24/should-geert-wilderss-cartoon-contest-be-allowed), is projected to take 35 out of 150 seats in the **Dutch** parliament, according to the first exit polls—putting it significantly ahead of other parties. The election was called after the sitting coalition, led by Mark Rutte from the centre-right Liberal party, [fell apart](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/10/mark-rutte-the-dutch-prime-minister-quits-politics) over migration policy in the summer.

**OpenAI** said it had agreed “in principle” that **Sam Altman** would rejoin the artificial-intelligence firm as its chief executive under a new board. The previous directors ousted Mr Altman last week, accusing him of misleading them. Most staff called for him to return and the board to resign. It could end an extraordinary saga, in which the sacked executive was snapped up [by Microsoft](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/21/what-revolt-at-openai-means-for-microsoft).

A vehicle exploded after crashing at high speed into a checkpoint on a bridge in **Niagara Falls**, killing the driver and passenger and injuring a border guard. The incident took place on the New York side of the Rainbow Bridge, an entry point to Canada. New York’s governor said there was “no indication” it was a terrorist attack.

**OPEC+**, a group of oil-producing countries, postponed a meeting of ministers originally scheduled for Sunday to November 30th. Although the group did not give an official reason for the delay, Bloomberg reported that **Saudi Arabia**, the group’s de-facto leader, is dissatisfied with other members’ oil production levels. [Oil prices](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/the-green-transition-will-transform-the-global-economic-order) dropped by 4% on the news.

**American** authorities foiled the attempted assassination of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist in the country, according to the *Financial Times*. Officials issued a warning to India’s government, which they believe could have been involved in the plot. In September [Justin Trudeau](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/19/a-devastating-accusation-by-justin-trudeau-against-india), Canada’s prime minister, said that “credible intelligence” linked **India** to the killing of a Sikh leader in Vancouver. India denied involvement.

**Thailand** captured 150 iguanas that had escaped to the countryside. The reptiles—which are imported from Latin America—have become popular pets among Thais. But the authorities imposed a ban on their importation earlier this week, saying the animals cause damage to agricultural produce. Breaking that law could result in a prison sentence of up to ten years.

### A truce in Gaza

The fighting in Gaza is expected to come to a four-day stop on Thursday, per a hostage release [deal](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/22/israel-strikes-a-hostage-deal-but-promises-the-gaza-war-isnt-over) between Israel and Hamas. However, on Wednesday an Israeli official said that at least part of the deal—the release from Hamas of around 50 of its more than 200 hostages—was delayed until Friday. The deal also includes Israel releasing roughly 150 Palestinian prisoners and allowing more aid into the enclave. Any respite, when it comes, will probably be short-lived, though the truce could be extended: each time Hamas frees an additional ten hostages, it buys 24 more hours of calm.

But Israel will resume fighting eventually. Some officials were reluctant to agree to a truce, lest it give Hamas time to regroup and bring pressure for a permanent ceasefire. The group’s leaders and many of its fighters are thought to have [fled to southern Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/15/the-battle-of-northern-gaza-is-almost-over), where Israel has yet to start a serious offensive. When the truce ends, the next phase of the war will begin.

### Russia’s waning regional influence

On Thursday President Vladimir Putin is expected in Minsk to attend a summit of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, a defence alliance that comprises Russia and five other former Soviet countries. His host, Belarus’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, hopes to foster renewed co-operation within the group. That will be a challenge.

Belarus [supports](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/03/17/how-belaruss-role-in-the-invasion-of-ukraine-could-grow) Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the group’s Central Asian members—Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan—are [wary of endorsing it](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/10/20/central-asian-countries-are-subtly-distancing-themselves-from-russia). They know that Russia’s imperial impulse poses risks to them, too. Armenia feels betrayed by the Kremlin after it failed to intervene in Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave that was mainly populated by ethnic Armenians before Azerbaijan (which is not a CSTO member) launched a [short offensive](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/19/azerbaijan-wants-to-reintegrate-nagorno-karabakh-through-force) in September, which sparked a [mass exodus](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/a-humanitarian-disaster-is-under-way-in-nagorno-karabakh). Armenian troops pulled out of recent CSTO military exercises, and the prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, will not attend the summit. The Kremlin may want to re-establish Russia’s empire, but its influence on the post-Soviet world is weakening.

### Turkey’s half-hearted battle against inflation

Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s tolerance for conventional monetary policy is being tested. Ahead of an election in May the Turkish president, a self-described “enemy” of interest rates, forced policymakers to make credit cheap. As a result, annual inflation rose to a high of 85%. Since [winning](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/28/recep-tayyip-erdogan-is-re-elected-as-turkeys-president) that vote Mr Erdogan has performed an [about-face](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/04/turkeys-president-erdogan-shifts-towards-sane-economics) to soften a currency crisis. Since July he has permitted the new central-bank governor to raise the benchmark rate by a cumulative 26 percentage points to 35%, the highest level in two decades.

Now Turkey’s $900bn economy is starting to sputter, with retail sales and manufacturing slowing. But the annual inflation rate is still more than 60%. Mr Erdogan does not want the economy to weaken ahead of nationwide mayoral elections next spring. So on Thursday the central bank is expected to opt for a smaller rate hike than in previous months. That will prolong its fight against inflation but may preserve Mr Erdogan’s patience.

### Extra-stressful Thanksgiving travel

America’s holiday season has kicked off. This year’s Thanksgiving period will be the [busiest](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/travelling-to-and-from-america-has-become-a-waiting-game) in recent times. Airlines in America predict record air traffic. The Transport Security Administration is expected to screen nearly 30m passengers—the highest number since its formation in 2001. The boom is partly caused by the rise in remote working that began during the pandemic, which makes it easier for people to stay with their families during the holiday.

But for airport staff a busy Thanksgiving brings more than regular holiday stress. On November 15th the Federal Aviation Administration published a report saying that out-of-date technology and a shortage of air-traffic controllers have become safety problems and put American aviation under serious strain. Although the country has had no major crash in almost 15 years, a number of close calls have made the news this year. Passengers and crew may be extra-thankful if their journeys are smooth.

### Art in the age of AI

On Thursday “The Irreplaceable Human”, an exhibition exploring human creativity in the age of artificial intelligence, opens at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art near Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital.

Among the show’s themes are worries about the effects of AI on children. An older version of that concern is expressed in Tetsuya Ishida’s “Mebae” (“Awakening”, 1998), a surreal painting of schoolboys who do not realise that their classmates are morphing into microscopes. Also on display is Andrea Büttner’s beautiful “Phone Etchings” (2015), based on the movements of her fingertips on a screen.

AI [sparks anxiety and excitement](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/20/how-to-worry-wisely-about-artificial-intelligence) in equal measure. Among the [jobs it threatens](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/03/06/dont-fear-an-ai-induced-jobs-apocalypse-just-yet) are those in creative industries. Three-quarters of Americans who responded to a poll by YouGov said that they worry that [AI will sap human creativity](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/09/now-ai-can-write-sing-and-act-is-it-still-possible-to-be-a-star). But 83% of respondents to a recent survey published in *It’s Nice That,* a magazine for commercial artists and designers, already use machine-learning tools for work. The new relationship between man and machine may be tense but creative.
