A **Ukrainian drone attack** on a naval base near Novorossiysk, a port on **Russia’s** Black Sea coast, reportedly damaged a Russian warship. The Kremlin said its forces had destroyed the drones, but video on social media showed a listing warship being towed to port. Clashes in the Black Sea have increased since Russia [withdrew from a deal](https://web.archive.org/web/20230804154851/https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/27/russia-is-attacking-ukraines-agricultural-exports) allowing the export of grain from Ukrainian ports.

**America** added 187,000 jobs in July, a figure slightly lower than many analysts had predicted. Job growth in the previous two months was also revised down. But unemployment fell to 3.5% from 3.6% in June. Meanwhile, wages rose by an annual rate of 4.4%. The figures suggest that the job market is cooling, but not crashing.

**India’s** Supreme Court suspended **Rahul Gandhi’s** [conviction for defamation](https://web.archive.org/web/20230804154851/https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/27/the-worlds-biggest-democracy-is-becoming-less-free). Mr Gandhi—who leads the Congress, the main opposition party—was sentenced to two years in prison and disqualified from parliament for making a remark about people named Modi, such as India’s prime minister Narendra Modi, in 2019. The ruling may mean Mr Gandhi can retake his parliamentary seat and participate in national elections next year.

Shares in **Apple** fell after the [tech giant](https://web.archive.org/web/20230804154851/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/02/can-big-tech-keep-getting-bigger-in-the-age-of-ai) reported a drop in revenues in the second quarter. Sales of iPhones, which account for nearly half of all revenues, fell by 2.4% year on year. Net profit, however, increased by 2.3%. The shift highlights Apple’s growing focus on digital services. The number of subscribers to services such as iCloud has risen by 150m over the past 12 months.

**Donald Trump** pleaded not guilty to [four charges](https://web.archive.org/web/20230804154851/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/02/donald-trump-is-indicted-for-trying-to-steal-the-2020-election) related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including conspiracy to defraud America. The former president and 2024 Republican primary front-runner was arraigned in a federal courtroom in Washington, DC. It was his third arraignment in four months; in the two others Mr Trump also delivered not-guilty pleas.

**Chinese** dealmaking in America was worth just $221m since the beginning of 2023, the lowest figure in 17 years. Tensions between the two countries, including a trade war around [semiconductors](https://web.archive.org/web/20230804154851/https://www.economist.com/business/2023/05/25/asian-businesses-are-being-dragged-into-the-chip-war), have dampened appetite for mergers and acquisitions in America among Chinese businesses. Chinese outbound mergers and acquisitions fell from a high point of $212bn in 2016 to $54bn in 2019.

Two **American** Navy sailors were arrested for sharing sensitive military information with **China**. According to prosecutors in California, the men received thousands of dollars to reveal details about defence equipment and operations. A senior FBI official criticised China’s espionage efforts, saying it would “[stop at nothing to attack](https://web.archive.org/web/20230804154851/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/03/30/why-the-china-us-contest-is-entering-a-new-and-more-dangerous-phase)” America.

### A Ukraine peace summit, without Russia

The two-day Ukraine-war “peace talks” to be held in Saudi Arabia this weekend will be of a curious sort. Ukraine will be there, as will America and the EU. Influential non-Western countries like Brazil, China and India have been invited. One country was notably absent from the invitation list: Russia, which started the war against Ukraine. A Kremlin spokesperson says that Russia will “keep an eye” on the meeting, which Saudi Arabia is hosting at its own initiative.

This is not actually a peace summit, in other words, but a moment for the West to lobby Asian, Latin American and African countries that have [stayed neutral](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/03/14/russias-friends-are-a-motley-and-shrinking-crew). Saudi Arabia has kept close ties with Russia, its partner in the OPEC+ oil cartel. It argues that the relationship could help it mediate an end to the war. But expectations are low. The summit will boost the kingdom’s image, but it is unlikely to make progress towards peace.

### What burgernomics reveal about the dollar

Since 1986 *The Economist* has used its Big Mac index to track the purchasing power of different currencies. Our latest data show that in America the median price of its most iconic burger rose by 8.3% in the year to July 2023—the beefiest increase since 2012.

Compared with the rest of the world, however, Americans have escaped lightly. From January to July, the price of the sandwich has risen more than twice as fast in the euro zone and Britain and nearly four times as fast in Canada. The purchasing power of their respective local currencies, [measured in burgers](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/03/the-dollar-is-now-better-value-says-the-big-mac-index), is dropping faster than the dollar’s.

But on foreign-exchange markets the greenback is weaker, not stronger, than it was in January. As a result it now looks undervalued against the euro for the first time in two years. Still, the greenback was unusually expensive before. The takeaway is that the dollar is now falling back to its fundamental value.

### Soaring rents at the Edinburgh Fringe

What happens when a city with a housing shortage hosts the world’s largest performing-arts festival during a cost-of-living crisis? The punchline—exorbitant accommodation costs—is not especially funny. But it is the reality facing performers at this year’s Edinburgh Festival Fringe, which starts this weekend.

The month-long Fringe has for decades helped little-known acts—such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote and performed “Fleabag”—to get their big breaks. But artists have long warned that the high cost of staying in Edinburgh makes it hard to perform there. This year, new regulations on short-term lets have made housing even scarcer: most flats are listed at more than £10,000 ($12,800) for the month. Some young performers have simply opted out of the Fringe. That will not help its reputation as a springboard for new talent.

### Shining a light on gemstones

Gemstones are natural wonders, forged by aeons of unfathomable pressure and heat deep in the Earth. For millennia, their beauty has pulled them across the world to bejewel distant kings. Now, scientists writing in AIP Advances, a journal, have used state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques to examine Egyptian gems for tell-tale signs of their provenance.

The researchers studied gems that came from the Red Sea’s Arabian-Nubian Shield. By shining lasers of different wavelengths on amethyst, emerald, amazonite and peridot, they found spectral signatures related to the quality and geological origin of the stones, which in some cases could be used to distinguish them from other gems. For example, the spectral signature of the Red Sea amazonite differed from the signatures of amazonite beads previously found at cultural heritage sites in Mexico and Jordan. In future, scientists could use this approach to identify the origins of gems of cultural and historical importance, or even to retrace ancient trading routes.

### Weekend profile: Jack Smith, the prosecutor pursuing Donald Trump

The president, prosecutors alleged, had persecuted his opponents and sought to thwart the investigation. This transpired in 2020 a world away from Washington, DC: the accused was [Hashim Thaci](https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/06/27/kosovos-president-hashim-thaci-faces-war-crimes-charges), Kosovo’s former president (and in his case the charges included murder). But the impassive, grizzled figure levying the charges was the same prosecutor who [indicted Donald Trump](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/02/donald-trump-is-indicted-for-trying-to-steal-the-2020-election) on Tuesday. No man is above the law, said Jack Smith, when he charged Mr Thaci. Not the leader of a tiny Balkan country then, nor the former leader of the free world now.

In November America’s attorney-general named Mr Smith a special counsel—a quasi-independent prosecutor—in charge of the multiple federal inquiries into Mr Trump. At the time, he was in The Hague, investigating crimes committed during the Kosovo war of 1998-99. Since becoming the top cop on the Trump beat, Mr Smith has indicted the former president twice, for [mishandling classified documents](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/09/donald-trump-is-in-his-most-serious-legal-trouble-yet) and for [conspiring to steal the 2020 election](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/02/donald-trump-is-accused-of-democracys-gravest-political-crime).

Mr Smith, aged 54, has been trying to nail crooks since graduating from Harvard Law School. First came a 14-year stint as a prosecutor in New York, where he would sometimes cycle to crime scenes. He won convictions in grisly, headline-grabbing cases: the shooting of two undercover detectives on Staten Island, the beating of a defenceless man by a cop in Brooklyn. Once, after he won a conviction in a murder trial, a besotted juror called out: “Will you be my lawyer?”

Between 2010 and 2015 Mr Smith helmed a division of the federal justice department investigating corruption by government officials. The “public-integrity” unit was in a funk when he arrived: its conviction of a senator had just been thrown out owing to prosecutors’ own misconduct. A year into his tenure convictions rose nearly sevenfold.

Mr Smith once told an interviewer that he aims to serve law-abiding folk who “pay their taxes, follow the rules and…expect their public officials to do the same”. Indeed former colleagues describe Mr Smith, an accomplished triathlete, as a stickler, both in his morals and in his methods. That makes him a perfect foil to the biggest target of his career. As Mr Trump would say, he is straight out of central casting.
