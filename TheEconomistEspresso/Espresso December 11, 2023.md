## The world in brief

### December 11, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Israel’s army** reached the centre of [Khan Younis](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/10/israel-has-just-a-few-weeks-left-to-destroy-hamas), a city in the [south](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/06/israel-is-pushing-into-southern-gaza-as-the-clock-ticks-down) of the Gaza Strip, after facing fierce resistance from militants. It also reported that it had flooded Hamas [tunnels](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/17/hamas-tunnels-under-gaza-will-be-a-key-battlefield-for-israel) beneath the city. On Saturday the UN warned that half of **Gaza’s** population is starving and that nine in ten people in the territory are unable to eat every day.

**Argentina’s** new libertarian president, **Javier Milei**, was inaugurated, and warned that it would not be possible to avoid a “shock” as he tries to [stabilise the economy](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/11/23/javier-milei-will-be-argentinas-first-libertarian-president). Annual inflation in Argentina is above 140%. One of the first things Mr Milei will have to do is cut spending, which has ballooned from 22% of GDP in 2003 to 38% today.

Voters in **Egypt** headed to the polls for the first day of a presidential election. **Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi**, the incumbent, is expected to be granted a third term despite the country’s economic crisis and disgruntlement over his government’s treatment of Palestinians affected by the war in Gaza. Many Egyptians are struggling to afford food as prices have risen more than 70% in the past year. Polls are open for three days and the result is expected on December 18th.

**Ukraine** transported goods **lorries** by train to **Poland**, bypassing the road border, which is being blocked by Polish lorry drivers. Polish hauliers are upset about the terms under which Ukrainian drivers are permitted to operate in the European Union. Thousands of Ukranian lorries are stuck in traffic jams at the border. Drivers in Slovakia recently started a similar protest.

In **Hong Kong** pro-democracy activists were arrested while protesting against unfair elections for the territory’s local **District Councils**. The government has manipulated the electoral process so that only candidates deemed to be “patriotic” are able to stand. Just 25% of eligible voters voted; [in 2019](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/11/28/hong-kongs-democracy-movement-has-gained-a-big-electoral-boost), when pro-democracy candidates were allowed, 71% did.

A **Philippine** boat and a **Chinese** Coast Guard ship collided in the South China Sea. China and the Philippines blamed each other for the crash, which happened near a part of the Spratly islands that both countries claim. Tensions have been growing over the South China Sea, much of which China claims without [legal basis](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/11/09/a-chinese-dispute-with-the-philippines-is-a-test-of-america). On Saturday the Philippines accused China of using water cannons to obstruct government ships there.

The children of **Narges Mohammadi**, an Iranian human-rights [activist](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/24/irans-women-prisoners-face-down-their-inquisitors) serving a ten-year prison sentence in Tehran, accepted a **Nobel peace prize** on her behalf at a ceremony in Oslo. In a speech smuggled out of prison Ms Mohammadi criticised the “tyrannical” Iranian regime and its laws on compulsory [hijab](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/07/a-year-after-iran-was-shaken-by-protests-zealots-have-tightened-their-grip) (headscarves) and insisted that “the Iranian people, with perseverance, will overcome repression and authoritarianism.”

### Confrontations in the South China Sea

A convoy of ships is due back in the western Philippines on Monday, having failed in its mission to spread Christmas cheer in the South China Sea. The plan had been to distribute gifts to Filipino fisherfolk and security-forces personnel on the front line of the maritime [confrontation](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/11/09/a-chinese-dispute-with-the-philippines-is-a-test-of-america) between the Philippines and China. The festive flotilla had also intended to show that the Philippines is serious about its claim to the disputed waters. These have economic value for the country—but are strategically important to China, which claims much of the expanse as its own.

The convoy turned back after Chinese security forces, including two navy ships, shadowed it. Chinese Coast Guard ships had just rammed and shot water cannon at different craft near the Philippine military outpost on Second Thomas Shoal.

The Christmas convoy had been due to pass close to the shoal, the most vigorously contested place in the Spratly islands. The garrison there will not get the goodies it was hoping for. But at least their country has called attention to China’s bullying behaviour.

### Israel’s push into Khan Younis

Gazans are running out of places to run. As the Israeli army pushes deeper into [Khan Younis](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/06/israel-is-pushing-into-southern-gaza-as-the-clock-ticks-down), a city in the south to which many civilians fled after the army told them to leave northern Gaza, it has now told them to move again. Thousands have arrived in Rafah, the southernmost city in the enclave. Beyond that lies only Egypt—but the border is closed. Displaced people sleep in makeshift shelters. Food and water are scarce.

President Joe Biden’s team is increasingly critical of the appalling humanitarian cost of Israel’s war in Gaza. But actions speak louder than words. On Friday the State Department approved a shipment of 14,000 tank shells to Israel.

Israeli officials think they have at most a few more [weeks](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/10/israel-has-just-a-few-weeks-left-to-destroy-hamas) to fight until America demands they stop. They are rushing to hit Hamas in Khan Younis, thought to be its main bastion. For Palestinians America’s demand cannot come soon enough.

### Oracle’s AI gamble

Another tech firm investing in artificial intelligence is Oracle, a software giant that reports its quarterly results on Monday. It wants to use AI to beef up its cloud-computing business. But the strategy is not without risks.

The cloud market is dominated by Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Oracle has a 2% share. But its cloud revenues are growing fast thanks to big deals, including one to host the American operations of [TikTok](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/09/23/can-tiktok-help-oracle-stay-relevant-in-the-cloud-computing-age), a Chinese-owned short-video app. It is also rumoured to be making a deal with X.ai, Elon Musk’s machine-learning outfit. Oracle’s cloud prospects are helped by its ability to buy plenty of sought-after specialised AI chips from Nvidia, a semiconductor maker.

A surge in Oracle's share price earlier this year helped its boss, [Larry Ellison](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/06/13/oracle-is-making-larry-ellison-the-worlds-third-richest-man), become the world's third-richest person. But his luck may not last. Oracle has a lot of debt, and its supply of AI chips is at the whim of Nvidia. Investors will be on the lookout for signs of weakness.

### France and Germany struggle to connect

A new night train will leave Berlin for [Paris](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/france-will-unify-for-sport-but-not-for-politics) on Monday, nearly a decade after the service was cancelled. The thrice-weekly Nightjet, which will take 14 hours to make the trip, is supposed to encourage Europeans to use more climate-friendly means of travel. But the new connection between the German and French capitals comes at an awkward moment.

Relations between the two countries are under strain, due to differences over energy and defence policy, the reform of the European Union’s fiscal rules and the [war in Gaza](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/07/israel-and-palestine-how-peace-is-possible). Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, have struggled to build up trust with each other.

This has not helped the run-up to the EU summit on December 14th and 15th, when leaders are due to finalise financial aid to Ukraine and decide whether to open up formal membership negotiations with the war-battered country. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, has threatened to derail those decisions. European political leadership is lacking, just when the continent badly needs it.

### Plant-based diets and pregnancy

In rich countries food has never been more bountiful. Yet a study published in *PLoS Medicine*, a journal, found that 90% of pregnant women in Britain, New Zealand and Singapore lack nutrients essential for foetal development.

Scientists at the University of Southampton, the University of Auckland and the National University of Singapore tested the nutrient levels in more than 1,700 women before and after they became pregnant. They also studied the effects of using supplements of vitamins B2, B6, B12, and D—found in meat and dairy products—during pregnancy. These nutrients are crucial for building healthy babies. Deficits can cause premature birth and lower IQ.

Worryingly, blood tests administered before the women took the supplements revealed that nine out of ten had low levels of at least one vitamin. The study’s authors called the issue “a serious concern” which can be attributed to the trend towards [plant-based diets](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/05/25/plant-based-proteins-are-no-longer-a-side-dish-in-diets). Luckily for vegetarians, the scientists also found that supplements can correct the deficiencies.
