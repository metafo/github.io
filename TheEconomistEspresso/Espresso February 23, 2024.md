## The world in brief

### February 23, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



Brett McGurk, President **Joe Biden**’s Middle East adviser, travelled to Israel to meet with **Binyamin Netanyahu**, Israel’s prime minister. Mr McGurk will help **Israel** negotiate the release of hostages held in Gaza. Meanwhile, Gaza’s health authority said that 97 people have been killed and 130 wounded in the last 24 hours in [Rafah](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/13/if-israel-invades-hell-looms-in-rafah), a city in southern Gaza, following bombardment by Israel. Some 1.5m **Palestinians** are sheltering in the area. The Israeli military is reportedly preparing to launch a ground assault in Rafah.

**Wall Street** closed on a high note on Thursday after **Nvidia’s** shares surged by 16%. On Wednesday the [AI chipmaker](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/31/could-amd-break-nvidias-chokehold-on-chips) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue of $22bn, a 265% rise from the same period last year. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 index rose by nearly 3%. The bumper earnings have also boosted global stockmarkets, including in Japan and Europe.

The mother of **Alexei Navalny**, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, said that she was allowed to see his body. She said that officials tried to force her to hold a private funeral, threatening to “do something” with the body if she refused. Navalny died in a **Russian** prison last week. The cause of his [death](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/16/how-alexei-navalny-robbed-putin-of-his-power) is still unknown.

**Turkey’s** central bank left its interest rate unchanged at 45%. To tackle skyrocketing [consumer prices](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/11/turkeys-economy-has-improved-but-its-foreign-policy-is-still-messy), the bank has increased the benchmark interest rate by a total of 36 percentage points in eight months. Although the annual inflation rate has continued to climb, reaching 64.9% in January, it is expected to dip by the start of the summer.

**Sir Lindsay Hoyle**, Britain’s speaker of the House of Commons, faced calls to resign. On Wednesday Mr Hoyle allowed the house to vote on a **Labour** amendment to a motion by the **Scottish National Party**, which called for a ceasefire in [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/04/on-gaza-europe-is-struggling-to-make-its-diplomacy-matter). That broke parliamentary convention. Although Mr Hoyle has apologised, that may not save his job: more than 60 MPs have signed a no-confidence motion.

**Mark Rutte**, the Dutch prime minister, has received the endorsement of around 20 [NATO](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/22/is-europe-ready-to-defend-itself) members to lead the military alliance, including America, Britain and Germany, according to Politico. He still needs to garner support of at least 11 allies to be elected. So far he is the only nominee, according to officials. Mr Rutte is set to leave office after his country holds elections in November.

Bobi, a dog, was stripped of his title as the **oldest ever dog**, which [Guinness World Records](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/11/10/anyone-can-break-a-guinness-world-record-i-did) granted him only last year. In January GWR began investigating whether Bobi really was 31 when he died in October—more than double his breed’s normal lifespan. The organisation said it found “no conclusive evidence”. It is unclear if Bluey, an Australian dog who died aged 29, retakes the title.

### History teaches the Marcos dynasty a lesson

A long weekend of demonstrations will begin on Friday in the Philippines, as opponents of the Marcos dynasty mark the anniversary of the People Power Revolution of 1986. The Philippines has elected two presidents from the Marcos family. The uprising toppled the first of those, Ferdinand Marcos senior, who had changed the constitution to give himself despotic powers. It restored democracy. Ferdinand Marcos junior, Mr Marcos’s son, was [elected president](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/06/29/by-electing-another-marcos-filipinos-show-they-have-forgotten-history) in 2022.

The president now wants to reform the constitution, ostensibly to do away with protectionist clauses thought to curb economic growth. The demonstrators suspect that the constitutional reform will allow the Marcos dynasty to follow its late patriarch down the path to despotism. Those suspicions are far-fetched. Mr Marcos junior, while seeking to rehabilitate his father’s reputation, knows that he led the family into a political wilderness from which it took decades to escape.

### Poland makes up with the EU

When Didier Reynders, the EU’s justice commissioner, visited Warsaw in 2021, Poland’s justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, handed him a photo showing the Germans’ destruction of the Polish capital during the second world war. It was a reminder, he explained, of foreign hostility towards Poland.

But the new pro-EU government, in office since December, has struck a different tone. When Mr Reynders visited last month Mr Ziobro’s successor, [Adam Bodnar](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/01/30/what-on-earth-is-happening-in-poland), handed him a modern photo of Warsaw’s skyscrapers. The pair subsequently hammered out an action plan, presented in Brussels on Tuesday, to [restore the rule of law](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/08/donald-tusk-tries-to-restore-polands-rule-of-law) in Poland—a condition to unlock billions of euros in recovery funds withheld by the EU.

The issue will no doubt come up when Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Reynders’s boss, visits the new government in Warsaw for the first time on Friday. Keen to end a years-long dispute, she will welcome compromise. Having just launched a [re-election campaign](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/15/how-not-to-botch-the-upcoming-eu-leadership-reshuffle) this week, she won’t mind posing for a picture-perfect handshake of her own.

### Germany’s economic outlook is bleak

Political debate in Germany is dominated by its economic weakness. A country used to being Europe’s economic star is grappling with demographic change, the decarbonisation of industry and higher energy prices. On top of that it is adjusting to a geopolitical rivalry between the West and China, with which Germany has previously been close. On Wednesday the government lowered its forecast for GDP growth in 2024 to just 0.2%. On Friday the widely watched ifo Business Climate Index of economic sentiment will probably add to Germany’s worries.

In the autumn, it had seemed as if the economy had bottomed out. Energy prices had begun to fall and the contraction of manufacturing seemed to have ended. The labour market remained strong and real incomes had started to rise, as wage growth overtook inflation. But other survey data on Thursday showed a fall in new orders for manufacturing. The [sick man of Europe](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/17/the-german-economy-from-european-leader-to-laggard) may take some time yet to recover.

### Warner Bros Discovery’s streaming dilemma

Nearly two years into the [merger](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/05/20/the-warner-discovery-deal-and-the-future-of-streaming) of Warner Bros and Discovery, the combined media company (WBD) still looks undersize relative to its rivals. Max, its new streaming service, combines content from Warner’s HBO (famous for “Game of Thrones”) with shows from Discovery (less famous for “Dr Pimple Popper”, which is exactly what it sounds like). WBD has fewer than 100m subscribers—less than half as many as the market leader, Netflix. It also trails behind Disney+ and Amazon Prime.

In an earnings call on Friday WBD will set out how it intends to grow. Next week Max will launch in Latin America, its first step into a foreign market. WBD is edging towards profitability by trimming spending on content and leasing its shows to [rivals](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/08/media-companies-club-together-for-a-joint-sport-streamer). But fewer shows means fewer reasons to sign up. Max could grow via another merger (Paramount, for instance, is looking for a suitor), but WBD’s $40bn in debt is an obstacle. Investors are changing channels: WBD’s share price has fallen by 60% since the merger.

### A film about a life well lived

“Perfect Days” doesn’t sound like the most promising night out at the cinema. The gentle slice-of-life drama follows a middle-aged man who drives around Tokyo and cleans its [public toilets](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/28/the-worlds-greatest-toilet-culture). But the humane and philosophical character study has rightly been nominated for Best International Feature Film at the Oscars.

The film’s laconic hero, Hirayama (Koji Yakusho), takes pride in his work. He is content to spend his spare time alone, reading novels, watering plants and taking photos. There are allusions to Hirayama’s affluent but troubled past, but he appears to be wholly focused on the present.

Although “Perfect Days” is Japan’s entry, the filmmaker is Wim Wenders, a German. The 78-year-old director is best known for “Paris, Texas”, “Wings Of Desire” and his documentary about Cuban musicians, “The Buena Vista Social Club”. “Perfect Days” is a highlight of an already glittering career.
