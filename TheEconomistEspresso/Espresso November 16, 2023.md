## The world in brief

### November 16, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



The **UN Security Council** passed a resolution calling for “humanitarian pauses and corridors” in **Gaza**; America, Britain and Russia abstained from the vote. The resolution also called for the release of all hostages by Hamas. Earlier, the **Israel Defence Forces** claimed to have found signs of Hamas, including weapons, inside the al-Shifa hospital when they raided it on Wednesday. Conditions at the hospital, the largest in Gaza, have been deteriorating for days, putting patients and the thousands of people sheltering within the hospital grounds at risk. On Tuesday America supported [Israel’s claims](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/06/israeli-soldiers-fight-to-reach-hamass-headquarters) that Hamas used the facility as a base. Doctors at the hospital denied the claims.

**Taiwan’s** main opposition parties, which want better relations with China, agreed to field their candidates on a joint ticket in the country’s [presidential elections](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/china-is-watching-closely-who-will-be-taiwans-next-president) in January. Polls suggest that together Hou Yu-ih, the Kuomintang’s candidate, and Ko Wen-je, leader of the upstart Taiwan People’s Party, could beat the candidate from the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party, which advocates strengthening relations with America.

**Britain’s** Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the government’s [controversial plan](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/07/04/britains-tough-asylum-plans-are-held-up-in-court-and-by-the-lords) to deport asylum-seekers to **Rwanda** is unlawful. The court cited the risk of the refugees having their claims unfairly assessed in Rwanda and then being returned to the country from which they had fled. Rishi Sunak, Britain’s prime minister, said his government was working on a new deal with Rwanda in light of the decision.

**New Hampshire** announced that its [presidential primary elections](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/02/08/waiting-for-bernie-in-new-hampshire) would be the country’s first, on January 23rd—setting up a conflict with the **Democratic National Committee**. The DNC earlier approved a new primary schedule that kicks off in South Carolina. New Hampshire’s Democratic contest is therefore unofficial: the DNC will not award delegates to the winner, and Joe Biden, the probable nominee, will not appear on the ballot.

**EY** announced that Janet Truncale will be its next global CEO. She will replace Carmine Di Sibio, who is retiring after a plan to split the company’s audit and advisory businesses [collapsed](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/04/16/why-ey-and-its-rivals-may-eventually-break-up-after-all) in the spring. Ms Truncale, currently the regional manager of the company’s financial services business in the Americas, will be the first woman to lead a Big Four accounting firm.

**Germany’s** highest court struck down the government’s plan to reallocate €60bn ($65bn) of funding to tackle climate change. The money was originally earmarked to handle covid-19 but was not spent; the government had hoped to dip into it to circumvent the country’s stringent “[debt brake](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/05/why-german-politicians-are-fighting-over-the-debt-brake)”. Christian Lindner, the finance minister, said the decision would have “far-reaching effects”, forcing the government to redraw its budgetary plans.

**India** beat **New Zealand** to reach the final of the Cricket World Cup. The hosts won their semi-final by 70 runs, gaining revenge on New Zealand, who knocked them out of the tournament in 2019. Virat Kohli, India’s star batsman, led the team to victory with a flourish, breaking the record for the most number of centuries scored in one day international matches with his 117 runs.

### Israel’s progress in Gaza

After almost three weeks of ground fighting, [Israel now has control ](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/15/the-battle-of-northern-gaza-is-almost-over)of the area north of Wadi Gaza, a riverbed that bisects the 45km-long Gaza Strip. This heralds the end of one phase of the war against Hamas. Israeli forces have dislodged the militant group from power in this part of the enclave. The group that has controlled Gaza since 2007 is scattered and reeling.

Yet Israel has still to find Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, and its military chief, Muhammad Deif. Both are thought to be hiding in the maze of tunnels beneath the enclave. Israeli troops will spend the coming weeks blowing up the entrances to those tunnels and scouring the north for arms and militants. Inevitably, some Hamas fighters will have fled to southern Gaza, along with civilians. At some point, therefore, Israel will have to turn its attention south. How much it will be able to do there, however, will depend on domestic politics and diplomatic pressure.

### Harder times at Alibaba

China’s biggest shopping day, Singles’ Day, which falls on November 11th, was something of a flop this year. E-commerce sales declined by 1% year on year. That is in keeping with this year’s sluggish trend in consumer demand. It is not good news for Alibaba, which has the biggest share of the e-commerce market.

Investors will get a sense of just how bad things are on Thursday, when Alibaba reports its second-quarter earnings. One advantage for the company is that it has several other major streams of revenue. But it is in the process of [splitting ](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/03/30/alibaba-breaks-itself-up-in-six)itself into six separate businesses, including ones offering logistics services and cloud computing. E-commerce will be by far the largest of these businesses. But after the break-up it will have to cope with poor consumer sentiment on its own.

### America avoids a shutdown

As early as Thursday Joe Biden is set to sign into law a bill that averts a government shutdown. The news is welcome—if perplexing. In September Republican Kevin McCarthy, then the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, [defied](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/01/by-averting-a-government-shutdown-kevin-mccarthy-risks-his-job) hardliners in his party and relied on Democratic votes to pass a short-term funding bill to avoid a shutdown. He was summarily defenestrated. Six weeks later, Mike Johnson, his replacement (pictured), did largely the same thing. Yet, for now, his job is safe.

Mr Johnson, knowing that Republicans would get the blame for a shutdown, needed a short-term solution. Though the bill lacked military aid for Israel or Ukraine, it was acceptable to Democrats because it included no spending cuts. Some members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus voted against it, but following the [weeks-long scramble](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/26/americas-house-of-representatives-finally-has-a-speaker) to replace Mr McCarthy, even they were not keen on more chaos. Overall, Republicans are giving Mr Johnson “a longer leash”, as one pundit put it, than the divisive Mr McCarthy.

### A new AI badge could change how we use technology

Naomi Campbell wore it first. A small pin on the lapel of an angular, pinstriped blazer intrigued onlookers at a fashion show in September. It was no mere decorative accessory. Instead it was a device intended to make handheld smartphones obsolete. On Thursday the AI Pin will be available for early orders in America.

Created by Humane, a startup staffed by former Apple employees, the AI Pin is a smart-assistant that attaches to clothing using a magnet. It differs from conventional smartphones by having no screen. Nevertheless, it takes photos, can access the internet, make phone calls, and project text onto surfaces (using lasers).

Generous funding of $240m from Microsoft, OpenAI and others has generated huge expectations in the tech market. Critics worry that a wearable device powered by generative artificial intelligence poses challenges for data protection. Using the pin will also require a substantial behavioural shift. Liberating the world from its smartphone addiction may yet require more technology.

### Giorgia Meloni’s passion for Frodo

An exhibition that has precious little to do with art, but much to say about the cultural enthusiasms of [Giorgia Meloni](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/09/giorgia-melonis-mother-of-all-reforms-is-a-power-grab), the Italian prime minister, and her hard-right Brothers of Italy party, opens to the public on Thursday at the National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rome.

The show is devoted to the British writer J.R.R. Tolkien, author of “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings”. Exhibits include manuscripts and letters, first editions of his books and art works inspired by his tales. Tolkien’s fantasy sagas, embraced by hippies in the 1960s, found a radically different set of admirers in Italy where they became the favoured reading of young neo-fascists. Ms Meloni, who once belonged to the neo-fascist youth movement, attended its “Hobbit Camps”. She has since often quoted from Tolkien’s works. Why Tolkien? For her culture minister, Gennaro Sangiuliano, his writings reflect “opposition to the most controversial and dehumanising aspects of modern times”.
