Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Egypt** said that **Israel** was not co-operating with efforts to deliver aid into [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/15/gazas-evacuees-are-racing-south-with-nowhere-safe-to-go) through the Rafah border crossing. Earlier Antony Blinken, **America’s** secretary of state, said that the crossing would be reopened, but Hamas and Israel denied that such an agreement had been reached. The **World Health Organisation** told AFP on Monday that there are only “24 hours” of water, electricity and fuel left in the Gaza Strip before a “real catastrophe” sets in.

Hamas said it launched a “barrage of missiles” towards Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, in retaliation against Israel’s “targeting of civilians”. At least 3,700 residential buildings have reportedly been demolished by Israeli strikes. Earlier the **Israel Defence Forces** said that at least 199 people are being held hostage by Hamas, more than it had previously estimated.

A **pro-EU** coalition led by [Donald Tusk](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/15/exit-polls-suggest-a-big-victory-for-polands-opposition), a former president, won a majority of votes in **Poland’s** election, according to partial results published on Monday. The country’s ruling Law and Justice party is in the lead but did not get a majority. The country now appears set to take a welcome centrist turn.

**Belgium** raised the terror alert in Brussels to the highest level after a gunman, who remains at large, shot and killed two Swedes in the capital. The authorities said they were treating the incident as terrorism, and France subsequently tightened its border controls. The victims were killed five kilometres (three miles) from a football match between Belgium and **Sweden**, which was abandoned at half-time.

A federal judge imposed “a narrowly tailored” gagging order on **Donald Trump**. It bars him from attacking Jack Smith, the special prosecutor charging him with [subverting](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/02/donald-trump-is-accused-of-democracys-gravest-political-crime) the 2020 presidential election; witnesses in the case; and court staff—but not the Justice Department, Joe Biden or the government more broadly. Mr Trump routinely likens Mr Smith’s investigation to a “political witch hunt”.

**Oil** futures dipped below $90 per barrel on reports that **America** would ease sanctions on **Venezuela’s** oil industry. The Biden administration agreed to the deal on the condition that the country’s authoritarian government allows a competitive and monitored presidential election in 2024, according to the *Washington Post*. The price of oil has risen since the outbreak of the war between [Hamas](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/10/how-powerful-is-hamas) and Israel.

The **International Olympic Committee** voted to include [cricket](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/13/cricket-will-make-the-olympics-bigger-and-better) in the 2028 games in Los Angeles. Squash, lacrosse, baseball, softball and flag football, a non-contact version of American football, will also be included. Cricket is the world’s second-most popular sport but has not featured since Paris in 1900; its re-introduction could bring in more viewers from South Asia, which may boost revenues.

### Xi’s Belt and Road bash

It is ten years since China launched its [Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/09/06/the-path-ahead-for-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative), a concrete-pouring binge powered by hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese loans and investment. On Tuesday and Wednesday the Communist Party plans to celebrate with a summit in Beijing. Representatives from over 130 countries are expected. The most prominent will probably be [Vladimir Putin](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/03/19/what-does-xi-jinping-want-from-vladimir-putin), whom Xi Jinping visited in Russia earlier this year. If Mr Putin makes it, it will mark his second trip abroad since the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest in March.

Western politicians, however, will be thin on the ground—and not just to avoid Mr Putin. BRI investments are smaller and more cautious than in the early years, when rich countries worried that China was trying to trap developing countries in debt. Yet increasingly [China](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/09/07/the-belt-and-road-as-seen-from-china) presents the scheme as only part of a package of global projects, which seek to spread not only ports and power stations but China’s democracy-free model of development.

### Israel’s war on Hamas’s tunnels

Students of urban warfare divide their battlefield into several planes: the sky, buildings and streetscape. But in Gaza tunnels will present the greatest challenge to the Israel Defence Forces when they begin [their invasion](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/brutal-urban-warfare-awaits-israels-army-in-gaza) in the coming days. In 2001 the militants of Hamas began constructing a remarkable subterranean network, to smuggle arms from Egypt, conceal weapons and make raids into Israel for attacks and abductions.

In 2014 the IDF launched an air and ground war targeting the tunnels and destroyed around 32 of them. Since then the IDF has invested heavily in tunnel operations, including new tech (such as robots that comb them with sensors) and specialised units. Its Yahalom battalion, an elite combat engineering unit, was reorganised, doubling from 400 to 900 personnel; it has even constructed its own versions of Hamas’s tunnels to practise on. Nonetheless, identifying, clearing and collapsing several hundred kilometres of underground warrens will take not weeks but years.

### Fortunes of war

Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company, reports quarterly results on Tuesday. Demands from defence ministries for munitions to support Ukraine and replenish national stocks remain strong. And Hamas’s assault on Israel caused American defence-industry stocks to leap by $30bn. But L-M’s earnings are expected to be slightly down year-on-year. Its share price before Hamas’s attack was its lowest since October 2022.

Arms spending within defence budgets is only creeping upwards. And L-M’s ability to accelerate the production of kit, such as the [HIMARS](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/21/how-two-new-munitions-could-affect-the-war-in-ukraine) ground attack system, fast enough to replace what is being used in Ukraine is restrained by shortages of rocket motors and skilled labour in America.

What Ukraine needs most—artillery shells and short- to medium-range air-defence missiles—are relatively low-margin. Delays to deliveries of pricey F-35s, which accounted for 27% of net sales last year but are not directly affected by the war in Ukraine, are having a bigger impact on the bottom line.

### Paying American college athletes

In America college sport is a huge business. The Big Ten Conference, an American-football league of 14 universities, makes $1bn-plus annually from television networks airing its games. The highest-paid football coaches earn about $10m. Yet players are sidelined. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, a rule-setting body, prohibits them from being paid.

Several years ago some states began letting athletes [earn money from sponsorship deals](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/05/21/why-college-athletes-in-america-are-fighting-to-get-paid); now 31 do. The idea was that they might be compensated for the use of their name or image, if not for playing. State laws vary, however, and the NCAA wants a national standard. On Tuesday its boss will testify before the Senate about what a federal law should look like.

More significantly, the NCAA wants Congress to codify that athletes are “amateurs”. Athletes on sports scholarships can have tuition and board paid for. But they contend that they are in effect employees of their schools, which are breaking antitrust laws by refusing them fair-market wages.

### Media’s 2D turn

Sonic the Hedgehog will race back onto video-gamers’ screens on Tuesday, in Sega’s “Sonic Superstars”. Three days later Nintendo’s Mario will return in “Super Mario Bros. Wonder”. If the revived hedgehog-v-plumber rivalry inspires nostalgia in ageing gamers, so will the look of the games: both are [two-dimensional adventures](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/12/mario-and-sonic-the-hedgehog-lead-a-2d-turn-in-entertainment) of the sort last popular 30 years ago before 3D graphics took over.

The 2D revival has also come to Hollywood. Films about Spider-Man and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, both released this summer, ditched the 3D look pioneered by Pixar films like “Toy Story” back in 1995, in favour of a sketchbook-inspired look known as “2.5D”. Disney’s “Wish”, due out in November, has a similarly flattened style.

Animators are enjoying the chance to experiment. So are studio bean-counters. Whereas hyper-real 3D worlds can take many years to create, the new games were developed at Sonic speed. So far, audiences seem to find one fewer dimension no less fun.
