The **Israel Defence Forces** said it mistakenly shot and killed three hostages who had been held by **Hamas**. The IDF apologised for the “tragic incident”, which it said happened in northern Gaza, and speculated that the hostages had escaped from or been abandoned by their captors. Earlier Israel approved the “temporary” delivery of aid to [Gaza](https://web.archive.org/web/20231216001041/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/14/israels-current-large-scale-operation-is-the-last-one-in-gaza) through its Kerem Shalom border crossing, which is located in the south. Jake Sullivan, America’s national security adviser, called it a “significant step”.

**Ursula von der Leyen**, the president of the European Commission, said she would seek an “operational solution” to provide funding for Ukraine in time for the EU’s next summit in March 2024. Earlier **Hungary** blocked a proposed €50bn ($55bn) EU aid package for **Ukraine**, shortly after the bloc agreed to [open membership negotiations](https://web.archive.org/web/20231216001041/https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/14/ukraine-takes-an-important-step-towards-eu-membership) with the war-torn country.

A jury ordered **Rudy Giuliani**, the ex-mayor of New York City and former personal lawyer to Donald Trump, to pay $148m in damages to two former election workers who sued him for defamation. After the 2020 election Mr Giuliani falsely claimed that the workers had manipulated ballots. According to the workers’ testimony, the bogus claims spurred violent, racist threats, compelling the plaintiffs to move house.

The **Houthis**, a [Yemeni militant group](https://web.archive.org/web/20231216001041/https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/12/who-are-the-houthis-the-group-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea), claimed responsibility for attacking two cargo ships in the **Red Sea**. The missile attacks signal the intensification of the group’s assault on the shipping lane. The Houthis claim to target ships heading towards Israel. **Maersk**, a freight company, told customers that it is pausing all journeys through the Red Sea until further notice.

Authorities in **Denmark** detained two people accused of plotting an attack, and said four others were under investigation, as apparently separate terrorism-related investigations unfolded across northern Europe. On Thursday **Germany** arrested three alleged members of Hamas on suspicion of planning attacks on Jewish institutions. Police in the **Netherlands** detained a fourth suspect in Rotterdam.

The former head of a southern branch of **Bank of China**, Xu Guojun, was jailed for life for embezzling 2.3bn yuan ($325m). The court said that Mr Xu, who led the branch from 1993 and 2001, exploited its fund management system to obtain fraudulent loans. The sentence comes as **Xi Jinping**, China’s president, [tightens his grip](https://web.archive.org/web/20231216001041/https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/15/a-new-super-regulator-takes-aim-at-rampant-corruption-in-chinese-finance) on the “hedonistic” practices of the country’s bankers.

The High Court in London ruled against **Mirror Group Newspapers** in 15 of 33 claims brought by **Prince Harry**. The court found that the senior royal had been a victim of phone hacking and “unlawful information gathering” by the newspapers. [Prince Harry](https://web.archive.org/web/20231216001041/https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/07/prince-harry-complains-again-this-time-in-court) had worried that “slaying dragons” would “get [him] burned”, but celebrated the ruling as marking “a great day for truth”.

### Word of the week: 

**Stolpersteine**, German for “stumbling stones.” They are brass plaques honouring the victims of the Nazi regime, installed in the pavement where they once lived.

### The beauty of “Maestro”

Bradley Cooper was the star, co-writer, and director of “A Star Is Born”, an award-winning film released in 2018. He does all three jobs again on “Maestro”, a biopic of Leonard Bernstein, a composer and conductor. Yet when photographs of Mr Cooper in the lead role were published in May, his notable multi-tasking was eclipsed by his make-up. Some commentators objected to a [non-Jewish actor](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/08/18/calls-for-actors-identities-to-match-their-roles-have-gone-too-far) using a prosthetic nose when playing a Jewish person.

Regardless, the film is a triumph. Far from being a conventional biopic, “Maestro” is an intimate character study which dramatises four decades of Bernstein’s dinners and parties. It ignores some of his artistic achievements, such as his score for “West Side Story”, to concentrate on his feverish energy, his depression and his loving marriage to Felicia Montealegre. Mr Cooper performs with electrifying passion; Carey Mulligan is dazzling as Montealegre. And, despite the criticism, the make-up is superb.

### Weekend profile: Félix Tshisekedi, DRC's president running for re-election

On January 24th 2019 Félix Tshisekedi’s voice began to fade. He was part-way through his speech at his swearing in as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sweat poured down his face. Then he stopped altogether and sat down. Allies quickly surrounded him. The national television station abruptly cut its feed.

A few minutes later the beefy Mr Tshisekedi resumed, blaming a tight bulletproof vest. Some wondered whether he might have been suddenly overcome with guilt about [an alleged deal](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/01/26/felix-tshisekedis-presidency-of-congo-begins-inauspiciously) he had struck with the outgoing authoritarian president, Joseph Kabila. Though Mr Tshisekedi was declared the winner, leaked data suggested that a rival, Martin Fayulu, in fact won 59% of the vote, and Mr Tshisekedi earned just 19%. On [December 20th](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/14/congos-crucial-election-may-be-heading-for-disaster) he hopes to be re-elected.

Mr Tshisekedi’s first campaign was replete with big promises. He pledged to raise incomes tenfold and turn Congo into the “Germany of Africa”. Despite strong growth, the number of people living in extreme poverty in DRC has instead increased. So have deaths in a long-raging conflict in the east, where rebel groups, some reportedly backed by Rwanda, have displaced some 7m people. In this campaign, having [failed to pacify the east](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/29/congo-says-martial-law-has-brought-calm-yet-violence-is-rising), he is simply promising peace again. Corruption, too, will be rooted out—again. One earlier pledge—to make primary education free—did, imperfectly, come to pass.

Mr Tshisekedi escapes the strains of government by watching football. Catching local matches, however, is tricky. When he attends the crowds sometimes chant “dollar *ekita*!”at him, Lingala for “the dollar is too high!”. Instead he tunes into matches in Europe, and his favourite team, Paris Saint-Germain. He has a general affinity for the continent. “Belgium is my other Congo,” he once said of the country where he has spent about half his life (and whose king, Leopold II, ran a murderous private colony in Congo from 1885 to 1908). This has not stopped him suggesting that his biggest rival, Moïse Katumbi, is a foreigner and implying without evidence that he is in cahoots with Rwanda.

Without credible polls it is almost impossible to predict who will win. But ahead of the election (for which the country is so ill-prepared that it may be delayed), posters of Mr Tshisekedi’s face line every road. “He craves the legitimacy he didn’t have last time round,” reckons a diplomat in Kinshasa. Still, he says, the incumbent “will win fraudulently if he has to”.

### A tricky election for Serbia’s ruling party

Serbs will vote in parliamentary and municipal elections on Sunday. These will be the sixth significant polls in nine years. Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia’s president, dominates the country’s politics. He called the snap vote in October after months of public pressure, which originated in anger over two [mass shootings](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/08/18/serbia-wants-to-show-how-to-disarm-a-country) in the spring.

Mr Vucic’s Serbian Progressive Party will almost certainly retain control of government. But polls show that opposition parties and coalitions could secure more than 40% of the vote, which could severely dent the president’s powerbase. They also stand a good chance of taking power in Belgrade, the capital. But, although Serbia’s many opposition parties are united in their stand against Mr Vucic, little else connects them. They range from monarchists and hard-core nationalists to greens and leftists. That lack of ideological unity will do them no favours. But it suits Mr Vucic, who could well have decades left in politics.

### The chicken of tomorrow

In June producers of “cultivated” meat, which is [grown in a lab](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/12/12/will-lab-grown-meat-ever-make-it-onto-supermarket-shelves), had some good news. Eat Just and Upside Foods, two Californian startups, became the first firms in America to win regulatory approval to sell the stuff. The production process starts by putting a cell from livestock or poultry animals into nutrient-rich liquid in a stainless-steel tank. After the cells multiply, they are harvested as edible tissue. That could take the form of a meat slurry or a more solid product.

Yet six months after the regulatory green light, the industry seems less optimistic. Costs are about five times that of conventional meat. And scaling production has proved tricky. Many firms are now focusing on selling hybrid products—mixtures of lab-grown and plant protein (such as soyabeans). The hope is that this could produce tasty morsels at a lower cost. Still, do not expect to find them on supermarket shelves any time soon.

### Chad’s contentious referendum

On Sunday Chadians will vote on a proposed new constitution. The poll is part of a transition towards elections in late 2024 in the impoverished central African country. Yet [Chad’s authoritarian ways](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/23/will-chad-be-the-next-western-ally-in-africa-to-fall) are unlikely to change.

In April 2021 the country’s former dictator, Idriss Déby, was [killed by rebels](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/04/22/chads-strongman-president-idriss-deby-is-killed-by-rebels). His son, Mahamat Idriss Déby, then took power unconstitutionally. That did not bother France, which has long backed strongmen in Chad in exchange for permission to house military bases in the country**.**

Mr Déby promised to stand aside after an 18-month transition. But he later added two more years to the period and declared himself eligible to run in elections. The referendum is nominally about whether to embrace a centralised state. Yet in practice, it is mostly to provide some legitimacy to Mr Déby’s extended stretch in power. Much of the opposition has criticised the poll, and called for “Non” or a boycott. “Oui” will probably win regardless.
