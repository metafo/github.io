Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

America announced the largest single package of [penalties](https://web.archive.org/web/20240224003340/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/21/even-the-toughest-sanctions-on-russias-war-machine-are-no-substitute-for-military-aid) on Russia since the war in Ukraine began. President Joe Biden said that he would impose more than 500 new sanctions as well as export restrictions on around 100 entities that provide support to Russia. He said that they are partly in response to the [death](https://web.archive.org/web/20240224003340/https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/22/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity) last week of Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader. America’s new package, however, will not cause considerable damage to Russia’s economy: it largely avoids sanctions against the country’s valuable metals and energy sector.

Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, presented his post-war plan for Gaza. Mr Netanyahu called for “complete demilitarisation” in the enclave and refused to recognise a Palestinian State. His proposal also includes plans for an indefinite Israeli military presence in[ Gaza](https://web.archive.org/web/20240224003340/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/22/the-wrecking-of-gazas-health-system-goes-beyond-its-hospitals). It does not mention the Palestinian Authority, which currently runs the West Bank. The plans are at odds with America’s.

Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, endorsed Sweden’s bid to join NATO during a visit from his Swedish counterpart. Mr Orban, along with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s leader, [blocked the Nordic country](https://web.archive.org/web/20240224003340/https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/01/31/can-anyone-do-anything-about-viktor-orban) from joining the security bloc for months. His reversal follows that of Mr Erdogan—as well as Sweden’s decision to send Hungary fighter jets. Hungary’s parliament is set to approve the bid on Monday.

Nvidia briefly reached a market value of $2trn for the first time, after its shares rose by more than 4% in early trading. The company’s bumper earnings report, released on Wednesday, has boosted global shares. In Europe stockmarkets reached a new [high](https://web.archive.org/web/20240224003340/https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/19/should-you-put-all-your-savings-into-stocks) on Friday. Shares in America and Japan also reached all-time highs on Thursday.

Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s ex-chancellor, was found guilty of perjury and received an eight-month suspended jail sentence. A court in Vienna ruled that Mr Kurz, a [former star](https://web.archive.org/web/20240224003340/https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/10/16/sebastian-kurz-is-forced-out-of-the-austrian-chancellery-again) among European conservatives, lied to a parliamentary committee investigating alleged corruption in the first (of two) coalition governments he led. He remains under investigation for more serious related crimes, though he has not been charged and denies wrongdoing.

Eight people were hospitalised with breathing problems in Stockholm after what initially appeared to be a gas leak at the headquarters of Sweden’s security service. Workers had reported an unusual smell; some 500 were evacuated. Later the security service reported that no gas had been detected. Police have launched an investigation.

Germany’s parliament approved a law legalising the [recreational use](https://web.archive.org/web/20240224003340/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/24/new-york-state-reckons-its-got-cannabis-legalisation-right) of marijuana from as early as April 1st. The law will allow individuals to grow and hold limited amounts of the drug for private consumption. The legislation was passed with 407 in favour, 226 against and 4 abstentions. The main opposition party, the conservative Christian Democratic Union, voted against it.

### Bolsonaro’s supporters take to the streets

Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s former president, is under investigation for his alleged involvement in a coup attempt. Police say he and his allies drafted a decree to overturn the election of his opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. After he had his passport seized on February 8th, Mr Bolsonaro called on his supporters to demonstrate on Sunday. In doing so, he said, they will show the world what they want: “God, country, family and freedom”.

Driven by similar words, thousands stormed Brazil’s Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace on January 8th last year. Although Mr Bolsonaro is now barred from holding office until 2030, 42% of Brazilians think the investigations against him are [unfair](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/09/11/jair-bolsonaro-fires-up-his-fans-by-attacking-judges). Congressmen, governors and mayors have said they will march on Sunday. Whoever Mr Bolsonaro chooses as his successor will pose a challenge to Lula in municipal elections in October—and in the presidential race in 2026.

### Belarus holds another sham vote

On Sunday Belarusians will vote in [parliamentary and local elections](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/22/belarus-prepares-for-another-fraudulent-election). The regime’s crackdown on dissent since 2020—when an unprecedented wave of protests followed a stolen presidential contest—has eliminated any real competition. The four parties on the ballot all back the president, Alexander Lukashenko, who has been [in power since 1994](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/05/25/why-belarus-is-called-europes-last-dictatorship).

Why bother with elections in a dictatorship? As well as the pretence of legitimacy, Mr Lukashenko has used the poll as an excuse to boast of his own achievements, ahead of his presidential run next year. Those include keeping inflation down and limiting his country’s involvement in Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Sunday’s vote will also trigger the appointment of the All-Belarusian People’s Assembly, a plenary body inscribed into the constitution in 2022. It will have powers to override elections and government decisions. Mr Lukashenko will run it, possibly until 2035. Its top echelons will serve as an arena from where the [strongman’s successor](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/05/22/what-happens-when-belarus-loses-its-dictator) is likely to emerge.

### New treatments for type-1 diabetes

[Type-1 diabetes](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/02/20/new-treatments-are-emerging-for-type-1-diabetes)—the sort caused by failure of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas—is famous in medical history for the development just over a century ago of insulin treatment. That was the first time an isolated hormone had been used as a medicine. The disease may soon clock up another such first, if efforts succeed to grow the missing beta cells from stem cells in laboratories, and then transplant them into patients.

For that idea to work well, though, the problems of rejection which accompany any transplant must be dealt with. That might be done by genetic engineering. As this year’s meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science heard, doctors are now seeking to edit the DNA of the transplanted beta cells to make them invisible to the immune system, and thus rejection-proof. A single test in a monkey has proved promising, and a human trial will begin soon.

### Harlem on our mind

In 1969 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York staged its first exhibition on the [Harlem Renaissance](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2021/02/10/passing-explores-race-and-identity-during-the-harlem-renaissance), a Black artistic movement concentrated in northern Manhattan in the 1920s and 30s. Yet “Harlem on My Mind” excluded art in favour of social history. Photographs of Harlem by James Van Der Zee and Gordon Parks were reproduced merely as wallpaper. When the show opened Black artists protested, some holding signs reading “Harlem on Whose Mind?”.

More than 50 years later, the Met will try again with “The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism”, which opens on Sunday. With some 160 paintings, drawings, sculptures, prints, and photographs drawn from numerous collections, this show takes a radically different tack. It argues that work by the likes of William Henry Johnson, Archibald Motley and Van Der Zee constitutes a major contribution to the international history of modern art. The show convincingly makes the case that Harlem should be on all of our minds.

### Weekend profile: Benny Gantz, Israel’s most popular politician

Four months after he joined an emergency government following Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7th, Benny Gantz is contemplating his next move. The former defence minister and commander of Israel’s army agreed to sit in a war cabinet chaired by Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu—his bitter rival. He did so mainly to ensure that Mr Netanyahu’s [far-right political partners](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/29/israels-new-government-is-the-most-right-wing-ever) would not be involved in war-making decisions. But as both the war, and talks for a possible hostage release and ceasefire agreement, continue, Mr Gantz’s patience is starting to fray.

The 64-year-old Mr Gantz rose spectacularly in the army, commanding some of the most storied combat units in the Israel Defence Forces before reaching the top job of chief of the general staff. But his path since entering politics five years ago [has been less smooth](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/03/21/benny-gantz-must-convince-israelis-that-he-can-protect-them). Mr Gantz failed to unseat Mr Netanyahu in a series of stalemate elections. In 2020 he agreed to serve in his government because of the covid-19 pandemic, but their partnership lasted a mere six months. In the last election, held in 2022, his centrist party, National Unity, received just 12 seats.

Now he is riding high in the polls. If elections were held today, National Unity would probably win double the number of seats of Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party. But forcing an early election in wartime would mean exiting the war-cabinet, which would leave Mr Netanyahu alone with the far-right when they could cause maximum damage.

Mr Gantz therefore faces a dilemma over when to leave. His aides say he has considerable influence, blocking a pre-emptive strike on Hizbullah in Lebanon and pushing through a week-long truce in Gaza during which 110 Israeli hostages were released. But Mr Netanyahu has occasionally sidelined him in talks over another ceasefire, which could bring about the release of the 134 hostages still held in Gaza.

If Mr Gantz were to replace Mr Netanyahu, it would not necessarily end the war in Gaza. Nor would it mean that Israel would automatically accept the peace plan being formulated by the Americans and the Saudis, which is based on a [two-state solution](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/12/07/despite-the-war-in-gaza-talk-of-a-two-state-solution-persists) that Mr Netanyahu has strenuously ruled out. In public Mr Gantz supports the continuation of the war until Hamas’s military capability is fully dismantled. He refuses to take a stand on a Palestinian state. But foreign diplomats who know him believe he would at least be open to discussing the idea.
