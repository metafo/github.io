## The world in brief

###  October 30, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

The secretary-general of the **UN** called the situation in **Gaza** a “humanitarian catastrophe”, two days after Israel sent troops into the strip. António Guterres warned that life there is “growing more desperate by the hour”. Supplies are limited and health services are collapsing. Earlier the head of the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees warned of civil disorder. Warehouses containing food aid have been raided by civilians. Yesterday Binyamin Netanyahu, **Israel’s** prime minister, said the **Israel Defence Forces** had entered a second phase of [the war](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/29/israel-faces-agonising-choices-in-the-battle-for-gaza). He warned of a “long and difficult” [operation](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/28/israels-new-plan-to-encircle-hamas) to “dismantle” Hamas and free hostages.

**Iran’s** foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, told CNN that the country did not want the conflict to “spread out”. Earlier Ebrahim Raisi, the president, posted on X that Israel had “crossed the red lines, which may force everyone to take action”. Mr Raisi said that America had asked [Iran](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/23/irans-ayatollahs-play-the-middle-easts-most-dangerous-game) and its **“axis of resistance”**—a network of proxies including [Hizbullah in Lebanon](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/13/israel-faces-the-danger-of-fighting-on-a-second-front)—for restraint.

Ahead of an expected meeting between **Joe Biden** and **Xi Jinping** in November, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said the “road to the San Francisco summit will not be a smooth one”. The two presidents are likely to meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Mr Wang said that both sides needed to “return to Bali”—a reference to the pair’s amicable [meeting](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/17/america-and-china-try-to-get-along) last year.

**Kenya** will end all visa requirements for Africans by the end of year. The country’s president, William Ruto, said that current visa restrictions were “working against us”. The African Union has long aspired to visa-free travel around the continent. The Seychelles, the Gambia and Benin all offer entry without a visa to African citizens; other countries are simplifying visa rules or reducing fees.

Authorities in **Acapulco** increased the death toll from Hurricane Otis, which battered the Mexican coastal resort on Wednesday, to 43. The category 5 storm caused billions of dollars worth of damage. Looting has been a problem in several areas amid shortages of food and water. Evelyn Salgado, the governor of the state of Guerrero, said that electricity had been restored to half of the city.

The **United Automobile Workers** is expected on Sunday to ratify a new contract with **Ford,** a carmaker. On Saturday the union reached a tentative agreement with **Stellantis** including a 25% pay increase for over four years. But after a setback in negotiations with **General Motors** the UAW expanded its action to include an engine plant. More than 45,000 workers have been striking against Detroit’s “[big three](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/20/americas-big-car-firms-face-lengthy-strikes)” carmakers.

In **Dagestan**, a Muslim-majority republic in southern Russia, a mob carrying Palestinian flags stormed an airport in the capital, Makhachkala, looking for Israeli and Jewish travellers arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv. Some passengers’ passports were checked by members of the crowd. In the nearby city of Khasavyurt rioters surrounded a hotel where they believed Jewish tourists were staying.

### Netanyahu’s battles

Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, begins the week fighting battles on multiple fronts. On Friday night his military leaders sent [troops](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/28/israels-new-plan-to-encircle-hamas) into the Gaza Strip with the aim of destroying [Hamas](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/10/how-powerful-is-hamas). But on Sunday morning Mr Netanyahu blamed those same leaders for the failure to anticipate Hamas’s terror attack. The prime minister and his generals are [damagingly divided](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/25/israels-prime-minister-and-its-army-are-damagingly-divided).

Following a press conference in which Mr Netanyahu evaded tough questions about his own [responsibility](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/09/hamass-attack-was-an-israeli-intelligence-failure-on-multiple-fronts), the prime minister posted on X that “every defence official” had briefed him before the attacks that Hamas was not planning a war.

The post caused uproar. Members of his war cabinet criticised him for blaming the security establishment at a time of war. Uncharacteristically Mr Netanyahu apologised, and deleted the post. But his accusations remain. The prime minister’s popularity was already plummeting. While the war in Gaza rages, so does Mr Netanyahu’s own battle for political survival.

### Money and politics in India

India’s Supreme Court this week delves into party finance as it hears a case on whether so-called electoral bonds are constitutional. These were introduced in 2017 by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to facilitate political donations. It claims they have formalised India’s political-funding system. Critics, including India’s election commission, object to the scheme’s opacity.

Unlike large cash donations, which require a party to disclose the donor, unlimited bonds can be bought anonymously. Since they are sold through the state-owned State Bank of India, the government can find out a donor’s identity but the public cannot. That raises the risk of corruption—why would anyone hand large sums to a political party on the quiet?

Almost all bonds purchased in the first year were above $12,000, suggesting the buyers were corporations and the very rich. Nearly 60% of all donations went to the BJP. That is bad news for [Indian democracy](https://www.economist.com/leaders/indias-democracy-is-not-as-healthy-as-this-months-elections-make-it-seem/21807621). The Supreme Court must decide if it is also illegal.

### German inflation on the way down

Interpreting recent German inflation data has not been simple. In 2022 the government subsidised the costs of some energy and transport, part of the basket of goods used to calculate inflation. In the 12 months after the subsidies were removed, the annual difference between the previous year’s suppressed prices and a given month’s current prices was bigger than it would have been without the subsidies: suggesting that German inflation was a bit lower than headline figures suggested. A full year on, these “base effects” have faded entirely and the annual rate of inflation has dropped commensurately—from over 6% in July and August to 4.5% in September. Inflation data for October, released on Monday, should come in at around 4%.

Data from the states of Berlin and Brandenburg showed inflation there coming down by roughly a percentage point from September. If Germany sees such a fall nationally this would be good news for its slowing economy: two important measures of economic activity are at levels that signal a recession. If inflation does not come down by enough, the European Central Bank may be forced to cut rates sooner than markets expect.

### Apple’s latest Macs

At a product launch on Monday in California, Apple is expected to introduce an updated range of Mac computers. The devices will probably feature new performance-boosting chips. The event follows the much-hyped introduction of its augmented-reality headset in June and an iPhone launch in September. When the company publishes its quarterly earnings on November 2nd, however, investors are unlikely to be looking at laptops or headsets.

Macs account for only a tenth of revenue, while iPhones make up half of sales. Analysts will pay particular attention to the Chinese market. In August the launch of a new high-end smartphone from Huawei, a Chinese tech rival, spooked investors. Days later news broke that Chinese officials might ban government employees from using iPhones. The two incidents raised investors’ fears of an escalation in the [trade war](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/14/apple-is-only-the-latest-casualty-of-the-sino-american-tech-war) between America and China. Apple’s share price sank. Signs of strong performance in China would come as a welcome relief for investors.

### The battlefront in deepfake technology

Last March, three weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky surrendered. A Ukrainian government website released a video of Ukraine’s president dressed in his trademark green, making the announcement, his scowling face shifting oddly.

The video was false: a realistic [“deepfake”](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2019/08/07/what-is-a-deepfake), disseminated by hackers. Similar digital legerdemain showed President Vladimir Putin announcing peace. Now, research by scientists at University College Cork, published in *PLOS One*, a journal, investigates how wartime deepfakes warp public opinion.

Analysis of 1,231 deepfake posts published on Twitter (now X) in 2022 found that they undermine public trust by causing real media to be mistaken for false. In April 2022, the Ukrainian government tried to illustrate the power of deepfakes by publishing one of Mr Putin admitting to Russian war crimes. But this study suggests that such stunts backfire. As [technology](https://www.economist.com/detecting-deepfakes-pod) improves, deepfakes will become artillery, with smartphones as the battleground.
