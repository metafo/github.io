Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Kevin McCarthy** was ousted as speaker of America’s House of Representatives in a vote forced by **Matt Gaetz**, a fellow Republican congressman. The motion to unseat him was supported by eight Republicans and all 208 Democrats present. Mr Gaetz, a firebrand from Florida, filed the “motion to vacate” on Monday after Mr McCarthy pushed through a [bipartisan spending bill](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/01/by-averting-a-government-shutdown-kevin-mccarthy-risks-his-job). The House has taken such a vote only once before, in 1910; that effort, however, was unsuccessful. Mr McCarthy’s exit threw the House into turmoil: the Republican majority has no ready replacement for him.

The **Nobel** prize in physics was awarded to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier for their work with light pulses—created by light from a laser passing through a gas—which are short enough to observe the rapid movement of electrons. Ms L’Huillier published her work in 1987. It was developed by Mr Agostini and Mr Krausz in 2001.

President **Joe Biden** spoke to the leaders of several NATO allies, aiming to reassure them that America would maintain its [support](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/21/ukraine-faces-a-long-war-a-change-of-course-is-needed) for Ukraine. On Saturday Mr Biden [signed a stopgap funding bill](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/01/by-averting-a-government-shutdown-kevin-mccarthy-risks-his-job) for America’s government that excluded aid for Ukraine. After the call Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general, reiterated that Ukraine’s allies were committed to supporting it “for as long as it takes”.

At least 21 people, including two children, died after a coach veered off an overpass near Venice in **Italy**. Another 18 were injured. The bus, which was carrying tourists from Ukraine, fell 30 metres (98 feet) and caught fire—an “apocalyptic scene,” according to the mayor of Venice. It is not yet clear what caused the crash.

**Poland** agreed to ease the passage through its borders of **Ukrainian grain** en route to other countries, raising hopes of an end to a long-running spat between the two countries. Along with other central European countries Poland has [banned imports](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/21/why-poland-is-halting-its-supply-of-weapons-to-ukraine) of Ukrainian grain, citing distortions to its domestic markets.

A UN humanitarian team completed a visit to **Nagorno-Karabakh**, where they were informed that just 50 to 1,000 ethnic Armenians remain. Two weeks ago Azerbaijan [took control](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/a-humanitarian-disaster-is-under-way-in-nagorno-karabakh) of the enclave from Armenian separatists, triggering an exodus of over 100,000 people to Armenia itself. Meanwhile, Armenia’s parliament voted to join the International Criminal Court, further straining relations with its former ally, Russia.

The **World Bank** revised up its growth expectations for **South Asia**, declaring the region’s prospects the strongest in the developing world**.** The bank expects South Asia to grow by 5.8% in 2023, up from a previous estimate of 5.6%. [India](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/13/america-is-courting-india-in-part-for-its-growing-economic-clout) is expected to grow by 6.3% in the current fiscal year. The bank warned that South Asian countries may still miss their development goals.

### India’s central bank meets

Earlier this year, the Reserve Bank of India thought its battle with inflation, fought with six consecutive interest-rate hikes, had ended. Starting in February, price increases had been steadily slowing. By May, the annual inflation rate had fallen to 4.3%, close to the central bank’s 4% target, allowing it to pause its tightening cycle. Since then, though, erratic monsoons have sent [food prices soaring](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/08/28/indias-surging-food-prices-are-a-problem-not-just-for-india), pushing inflation to 6.8% in August, higher than even the RBI’s upper limit of 6%.

Still, when the RBI begins a three-day meeting on Wednesday economists expect it to leave interest rates at 6.5%. Shaktikanta Das, the governor, has insisted that the rise in food prices is temporary and expects inflation to fall in the coming months. Risks, however, remain. The rising price of oil could push up inflation further, and crops could still be hit by the uneven monsoons. The RBI’s tussle with inflation continues.

### The Vatican’s new priorities

These are radical times by Vatican standards. On Saturday Pope Francis swore in 21 new cardinals. On Wednesday he will publish an apostolic exhortation—a type of papal pronouncement—entitled “Laudate Deum” (“Praise God”) and focusing on environmental concerns. The document develops on Francis’s “Laudato si” (“Praise Be”), [published in 2015](https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2015/04/28/a-green-wearing-white), which John Kerry, America’s climate envoy, has said had a “profound impact” on the signing of the Paris Agreement.

Wednesday will also see the start of a meeting about how the Roman Catholic church functions. The General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops—a body that advises the pope—will be convened and given 12 months to find ways to make the church less hierarchical. Accordingly, of the 370 voting members around 70 are non-bishops, some of whom are members of the laity and roughly half of whom are women. Francis recently made a nun one of the Synod’s under-secretaries. Other changes may be afoot, too: he has hinted at the possibility of blessing same-sex unions.

### Biden officials talk drugs in Mexico

In September Ovidio Guzmán—the son of “[El Chapo](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/26/a-trial-in-new-york-exposes-us-mexican-counter-narcotics-tensions)”, a notorious Mexican drug lord—was extradited to America to face drug-trafficking charges. Court documents accuse him of “flooding” American cities with [fentanyl](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/27/fentanyl-is-spreading-the-opioid-crisis-into-americas-big-cities), a dangerous synthetic opioid. This week American officials are making the reverse trip, flying south for a high-level meeting with Mexican officials on organised crime and drug smuggling on Tuesday and Wednesday.

There is outrage in America over the flow of drugs across the border. The Biden administration must show that it has a plan, and that Mexico is co-operating with it. While in Mexico City Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, will meet Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico’s president.

Many [Republicans](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/20/how-mexico-has-become-the-enemy-of-americas-republicans) favour harsher tactics. The House of Representatives recently voted to cut aid to Mexico as punishment for its failure to curtail fentanyl production. Some Republican candidates for the presidency even talk of [bombing](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/14/why-americas-republicans-want-to-bomb-mexico) the laboratories out of existence.

### Britain’s government derails HS2

The future of [HS2](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/25/why-britains-government-would-be-wrong-to-cut-hs2), a long-planned high-speed rail network, has rarely seemed secure. After weeks of speculation Rishi Sunak, Britain’s prime minister, is on Wednesday expected to axe one planned line, from Birmingham to Manchester.

Estimated costs for the network have spiralled from £37.5bn in 2009 (then $62bn) to as much as £100bn ($121bn) today. The project has already been cut back. A line from Birmingham to Leeds was dropped in 2021. Rather than coming into London, trains will stop 10km outside (at least initially).

After the latest cancellation Britain will have spent tens of billions of pounds on 140 miles (225km) of track. Mr Sunak’s Conservative Party, which is convening this week in Manchester, has wasted political capital too. Mr Sunak is expected to argue that the money saved can be better spent on new east-west rail connections across the north. Rail-industry experts are sceptical. Existing plans for the so-called [Northern Powerhouse Rail](https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/04/04/the-northern-powerhouse-may-not-be-as-dead-as-it-looks) rely on HS2 having already been built.

### How earthworms help harvests

The UN estimates that the number of people facing acute food insecurity, caused by war and extreme weather, more than doubled between 2021 and 2023, with 345m now facing hunger. Increasing crop yields is critical. Artificial fertilisers are one way. But scientists are realising that natural organisms provide anothere.

A paper in *Nature* finds that each year earthworms, which eat and excrete plant matter, may improve annual global yields of grains, like rice and wheat, by 128m tonnes. Researchers from Colorado State University reach that estimate by merging maps of earthworm counts and crop growth. Combining soil data from 58 previous studies, they show that in sub-Saharan Africa earthworms are responsible for 10% of total grain production.

Wriggly soil-dwellers capture water and release hormones, which help plants grow. They can even trigger plants’ defences against pests. Other [organisms](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/02/20/knowing-how-plants-and-microbes-work-together-can-boost-crop-yields), like bacteria, play a similar role. The importance of such underground critters is coming to the surface.
