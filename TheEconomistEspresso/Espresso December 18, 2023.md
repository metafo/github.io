Some of **Israel**’s allies stepped up their calls for peace in **Gaza**. The British and German foreign ministers together urged a “sustainable ceasefire”, and said that Israel had killed “too many civilians”. Their French counterpart went further, calling for an “immediate and durable” truce. Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, began a Middle East trip during which he is expected to press Israel to scale back its military operation. Meanwhile, Israel allowed aid to enter Gaza via the Kerem Shalom border crossing for the first time since Hamas’s October 7th attacks.

The Egyptian Suez Canal Authority said it was “closely following” events in the **Red Sea**. Over the weekend American and British destroyers downed more than a dozen drones over the sea, apparently launched by the **Houthis**, an Iran-backed [Yemeni militant group](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/12/who-are-the-houthis-the-group-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea) that claims to target ships heading towards Israel. Several shipping companies have announced that they are suspending voyages through the Red Sea, a crucial artery for world trade.

**Chileans** voted in a referendum on whether to replace the **constitution**, which dates back to 1980 and the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. It is the second such vote in as many years. The previous draft replacement, put forward by an elected body dominated by left-wing delegates, was rejected. The current proposal is more conservative and includes provisions to beef up property rights.

President Vladimir **Putin** warned of “problems” with **Finland**, accusing the West of having “dragged” Russia’s Nordic neighbour into NATO. The remarks came after Finland closed its border with Russia, saying that the Kremlin had orchestrated a migrant crisis there. Mr Putin said he would move “military units” towards Russia’s border with Finland. Prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland joined NATO in April after decades of non-alignment.

**Lindsey Graham**, an American Republican senator, said that negotiators were “not anywhere close” to unlocking an **aid package for Ukraine**. In exchange for agreeing to the funding, Congressional Republicans want to extract concessions from Democrats on border and asylum policy. Mr Graham said he expected the negotiations to rumble on into the new year.

Foreign dignitaries arrived in **Kuwait** to offer condolences for the death of the emir**,** Sheikh Nawaf al-Sabah, who died on Saturday at the age of 86. Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, represented President Joe Biden. Jordan’s King Abdullah, Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Palestinian Authority, were also present. The emir had ruled the tiny, but important, Gulf state since the demise of his half-brother in 2020.

For the first time in the history of the Church of England, an Anglican priest officially blessed a same-sex marriage. The blessing ceremony—not a full-blown wedding—took place at a church in Felixstowe. The happy couple, both associate priests at the church, were able to take advantage of a modest relaxation in the rules approved at the CoE’s General Synod in February. A ban on same-sex church weddings remains in place.

### Ukraine’s long war

*This week we are looking back on 2023. Today, the year in conflict*

Last year territory swiftly changed hands in Russia’s war against Ukraine. But in 2023 the battlefield movements largely slowed to a crawl. At the start of the year Russia was conducting an assault on Bakhmut, a town in eastern Ukraine that took on totemic status (it eventually fell). The offensive was led by the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary outfit. In June its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, launched a [stunning mutiny](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/25/prigozhins-strange-aborted-coup-is-a-sign-of-russias-malaise) against Russia’s military chiefs, which rattled the authority of President Vladimir Putin. (Mr Prigozhin was later [killed](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/23/yevgeny-prigozhins-reported-death-may-consolidate-putins-power) in a mysterious plane crash near Moscow.)

For Ukraine, excitement grew over a counter-offensive that eventually started in the summer. But its territorial gains proved minimal. That led General Valery Zaluzhny, head of the Ukrainian armed forces, to [tell *The Economist*](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/01/ukraines-commander-in-chief-on-the-breakthrough-he-needs-to-beat-russia) that the conflict had reached a stalemate. His comments caused consternation in Kyiv and in the West. Still, it is clear that Ukraine and its backers [must be ready](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/europe-needs-to-step-up-support-for-ukraine) for a grinding war of attrition.

### Conflict rocks the Middle East

*This week we are looking back on 2023. Today, the year in conflict*

Israel’s relations with the Arab world appeared to be normalising in 2023. There was even talk of an [America-brokered deal](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/24/america-israel-and-saudi-are-at-the-cusp-of-a-deal) to establish formal diplomatic ties between the Jewish state and Saudi Arabia. But on October 7th Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that runs the Gaza Strip, [launched an attack](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/07/israel-reels-as-hamas-launches-a-spectacular-and-bloody-offensive) on Israel in which it killed 1,200 people and kidnapped hundreds more. Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes and invasion of Gaza have killed tens of thousands.

Israel aims to find Hamas’s leaders and destroy its command centres, largely housed in a vast network of [underground tunnels](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/17/hamas-tunnels-under-gaza-will-be-a-key-battlefield-for-israel). Yet civilians are caught in the crosshairs. international concern has grown as strikes hit refugee camps and Israeli troops entered [al-Shifa hospital](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/18/was-israels-attack-on-al-shifa-hospital-justified), Gaza’s largest. Warnings that large-scale conflict might spread across the Middle East have so far not come to pass. And a temporary truce saw some hostages released. But many remain in captivity—and the war in Gaza is far from over.

### Decisive changes in the Caucasus

*This week we are looking back on 2023. Today, the year in conflict*

Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic-Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan’s borders, has been the site of intermittent conflict for decades. This year the fighting was short but decisive. In September Azerbaijan [launched a brief offensive](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/21/azerbaijan-is-close-to-taking-control-of-nagorno-karabakh) that forced the separatist government to surrender and disband. The majority of the population, which stood at around 120,000 people before the fighting, fled their homes, sparking a [humanitarian crisis](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/a-humanitarian-disaster-is-under-way-in-nagorno-karabakh).

In early December Armenia and Azerbaijan said they would work towards normalising relations. Yet the fallout from the conflict continues to reverberate. Armenia feels [betrayed by Russia](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/how-the-war-in-ukraine-is-changing-the-caucasus), its historic ally, which had said it would try to ensure peace in the enclave but in the event stood largely by. Russia’s passivity partly reflects its disdain for Nikol Pashinyan, Armenia’s prime minister, who swept aside a corrupt, pro-Kremlin regime in 2018. But the outcome of the war also highlights Russia’s waning influence in the region as well as the growing clout of other powers, notably Turkey, Azerbaijan’s backer.

### A forgotten war in Sudan

*This week we are looking back on 2023. Today, the year in conflict*

In 2021 the Sudanese Armed Forces—the national army—and the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group, worked together to stage a coup that blocked the emergence of a civilian-led government. Less than two years later they became engaged in a power struggle that, in April, [sparked civil war](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/16/khartoum-has-exploded-into-open-warfare) in Africa’s third-largest country.

In its first seven months the fighting claimed at least 10,000 lives and saw some 6.3m people displaced. Parts of Khartoum, the capital, were flattened. The RSF now controls most of Darfur, a vast western region, where there is credible evidence that the militia has perpetrated genocidal killings against the Masalits, a black-African ethnic group.

Talks between the SAF and the RSF, brokered by America and Saudi Arabia, have taken place in Jeddah. But the RSF is unlikely to step back from a war it is winning. Many fear that the world is allowing the collapse of the Sudanese state to pass almost unnoticed.
