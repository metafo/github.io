Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



Israel’s prime minister, **Binyamin Netanyahu,** told his cabinet that the country must keep fighting **Hamas** in Gaza, despite the “very heavy price” being paid by its forces. More than 150 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Israel began its ground offensive on October 27th. Inside Gaza more than 20,000 Palestinians have died. After concentrating their efforts for weeks on northern **Gaza**, Israel’s forces announced on Sunday that they would increasingly turn their attention to fighting Hamas in the south. On Saturday the forces also said that they had detected a number of “launches” originating in Lebanon and had retaliated.

**Iran’s** navy received a delivery of Iranian-made Talaeiyeh **cruise missiles**, which have a range of 1,000km, as well as drones and helicopters. On Saturday America said that a drone fired from Iran struck a tanker off the coast of India, and a US Navy destroyer patrolling the **Red Sea** shot down four drones flying from the part of Yemen controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi militant group.

**Ukrainian** lorries resumed moving across one of the country’s border crossings with Poland after **Polish** farmers ended a blockade outside the town of Medyka. Polish lorry drivers, however, are expected to maintain separate blockades at three other crossings over Christmas. Some Polish hauliers and farmers are unhappy with the access Ukrainian companies have to the European Union.

Authorities in **Chad** said voters had backed a new constitution, which the ruling junta says is a crucial step towards holding elections next year. The old constitution was suspended after the previous president, Idriss Déby, was killed by rebels in 2021. Chad’s current leader, Déby’s son, Mahamat Idriss Déby, has reneged on [several promises](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/23/will-chad-be-the-next-western-ally-in-africa-to-fall) about holding elections since replacing his father.

**Moldova’s** president, Maia Sandu, said that she would seek a second term in elections late next year and urged the country’s parliament to call a referendum in the autumn on joining the European Union. This month EU leaders agreed to open accession talks with the eastern European country as well as with its neighbour, [Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/14/ukraine-takes-an-important-step-towards-eu-membership).

Sir Jim Ratcliffe agreed to buy 25% of **Manchester United** in a deal valuing the English football club, controlled by the American Glazer family, at around $6.3bn. Sir Jim—founder of INEOS, a chemicals firm with several sporting investments—had earlier bid for a majority stake. United are having a disappointing season: they lie eighth in the Premier League and this month were eliminated from European competition.

### 2024 in preview: stalemate in Ukraine will mean difficult decisions

*This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Europe, the Middle East and Africa?*



It was apparent by mid-autumn that Ukraine’s counter-offensive, which started in June, had stopped well short of its stated minimum goal. The winter will probably see an intense campaign of long-range strikes from both sides, including on power grids. That may lift morale, but the strategic impact will probably be modest. The war may have become a [stalemate](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/01/ukraines-commander-in-chief-on-the-breakthrough-he-needs-to-beat-russia).


The crucial question for 2024 is which side can rebuild its forces more quickly. Russia’s army, which has fallen short of its recruitment targets, will need a mobilisation push; Ukraine must decide whether to conscript more men in their younger 20s. As for weapons, Russia ramped up defence production in late 2022, giving it an edge over Ukraine in artillery ammunition. The West is focusing on repairing and not replacing Ukraine’s equipment. If neither side can generate a meaningful offensive threat in 2024, the war’s trajectory may be shaped by the [political resilience](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/27/ukraines-new-enemy-war-fatigue-in-the-west) of both countries’ leaders and their international partners.

### 2024 in preview: a rebalancing awaits the Middle East

The past year did not bring the expected de-escalation to the Middle East. The Israel-Hamas [war](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/20/the-a-to-z-of-the-arab-israeli-conflict) overshadowed the detente between [Iran and Saudi Arabia](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/23/irans-ayatollahs-play-the-middle-easts-most-dangerous-game). It has also complicated the normalisation of [Israeli-Saudi relations](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/22/are-the-abraham-accords-over)—though talks rumble on quietly. The conflict has [spooked other regional regimes](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/11/02/could-the-israel-hamas-war-trigger-unrest-across-the-arab-world), causing them to turn inwards to ensure their own survival. Heavily indebted [Egypt](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/29/as-the-gaza-war-rages-egypt-fears-for-its-stability) now faces wars on two borders, in Gaza and Sudan; Jordan is worried that a long conflict in the Holy Land will spark unrest among its own large Palestinian population. The Gulf states want to protect their oilfields from becoming targets.

Russia and [China](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/10/china-brokers-an-iran-saudi-rapprochement), which in past years have accumulated both hard and soft power across the region, seem confused and disinterested. Meanwhile, America has returned to the fray. A planned mutual-security pact with Saudi Arabia may now appeal less to policymakers in Washington. [America might wish to be done](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/24/the-overstretched-superpower) with the Middle East—but the Middle East is [not done with America](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/19/the-stakes-could-hardly-be-higher-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict).

### 2024 in preview: African countries will scrimp on investment

Sub-Saharan Africa’s growth prospects for next year are modest. The region’s GDP expanded by 4% in 2022 and is forecast to grow by 3.3% in 2023. The IMF reckons on 4% in 2024. Alongside population growth of about 2.6%, that is not a combination for widespread prosperity. Worse, the region may not surpass these modest rates any time soon.

Most [African economies](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/13/why-africa-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-continents-in-the-world) lack what they need for transformational economic growth: a well-educated workforce, reliable roads and electricity, and clean government. Tight finances will undercut the development of those factors. Cash has dried up as a result of the covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and [debt-fuelled spending](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/16/africa-faces-a-mounting-debt-crisis), often with poor returns. (Ghana and Zambia are already in default.)

[Rising interest rates](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/30/debt-repayment-costs-are-rising-fast-for-many-african-countries) have locked most countries in sub-Saharan Africa out of global debt markets. There are few good alternatives: the IMF and World Bank offer limited programmes, and [Chinese loans](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/18/china-and-the-west-take-a-step-to-ease-africas-debt-crisis) are drying up. As China struggles with its [own economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/23/how-to-save-chinas-economy), a rebound seems unlikely.

### 2024 in preview: the fight to rule Britain may get dirty

Britain [must hold an election](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/03/when-should-rishi-sunak-call-the-next-british-election) by January 2025. Many in the governing Conservative Party think October 2024 is their best option as that would allow inflation to abate and incomes to recover. But Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, may want to align with the local elections in May, to prevent a bad result hobbling an autumn campaign.

The state of the [economy](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/14/why-britain-has-a-unique-problem-with-economic-inactivity) and public services (notably in ailing [public health](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/britains-nhs-will-continue-to-be-a-political-hot-potato-in-2024) and [justice](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/23/britains-family-court-system-is-overwhelmed)) will figure heavily. Labour has outlined a programme of subsidies and homebuilding deregulation to kick-start growth. The Tories, meanwhile, will hammer away at voters’ lingering doubts about Labour’s fiscal rectitude.

If the Conservatives continue to trail in polls, they may gamble on various issues. They will also attack Labour by painting its leader, [Sir Keir Starmer](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/10/even-when-he-glitters-sir-keir-starmer-is-still-quite-dull), as an indecisive metropolitan who is soft on crime and migration. Labour will hit back, portraying Mr[ Sunak](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/23/what-kind-of-legacy-does-rishi-sunak-want-to-leave-behind) as a weak, aloof moneybags.
