Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

In a surprise move the **EU** agreed to [open membership negotiations ](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/the-war-in-ukraine-is-a-powerful-reason-to-enlarge-and-improve-the-eu)with **Ukraine.** Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, had threatened to veto the decision (which requires unanimous approval), but reportedly left the room when it was put to a vote among the 27 heads of government. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, hailed the decision as a “victory for Ukraine”. The EU also agreed to open accession talks with Moldova, and to grant candidate status to Georgia.

The **Bank of England** and the **European Central Bank** held interest rates steady, at 5.25% and 4% respectively. Neither bank suggested that rate cuts are imminent. Earlier the **Federal Reserve** also left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25-5.5%, but it signalled that it would loosen monetary policy [next year](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/13/the-fed-gives-in-to-the-clamour-for-looser-money).

Jake Sullivan, **America’s** national security adviser, told **Israel** to reduce the “intensity” of its war in **Gaza** “in the near future”. During meetings with officials—including Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu—in Tel Aviv, Mr Sullivan suggested they [transition](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/14/israels-current-large-scale-operation-is-the-last-one-in-gaza) to targeted operations that inflict fewer civilian casualties. Yoav Gallant, the defence minister, countered that defeating Hamas “will require a long period of time”.

Médecins Sans Frontières, an aid group, suspended work in a hospital in Port-au-Prince, **Haiti’s** capital, after an armed group executed a patient outside an ambulance on Tuesday. The country is so plagued by violent gangs that Ariel Henry, the prime minister, [asked for foreign](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/10/20/an-american-backed-foreign-force-may-be-sent-to-haiti) help last year. An international security mission, approved by the UN in October, is expected to arrive within months.

The **International Energy Agency** said that growth in demand for **oil** has slowed “drastically”. The watchdog cited reasons including higher interest rates and stagnant economic activity in regions such as Europe and the Middle East. The IEA also said that **OPEC+**, a cartel, now controls just 51% of global oil production, partly because of America’s growing output.

**Japan’s** prime minister, **Kishida Fumio**, sacked four cabinet ministers in an attempt to save his government from a financial scandal. Authorities are investigating claims that the ruling [Liberal Democratic Party](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/10/28/how-the-ldp-dominates-japans-politics) failed to report around ¥500m ($3.5m) in funding. A poll on Thursday showed collapsing support for Mr Kishida, with just 17% of respondents saying they backed his government.

The **Cannes Film Festival** announced that **Greta Gerwig**, the director of “[Barbie](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/07/14/realism-with-oppenheimer-or-escapism-with-barbie)”, would preside over its jury in 2024. She will be the youngest president at Cannes since 1966 and the first female president since Cate Blanchett, an Australian actor, in 2018. Ms Gerwig said that the festival “has always been the pinnacle” of “what movies can be”.

### Russia’s economy is dangerously hot

As inflation falls the world over, in Russia it is rising. In November prices rose by 7.5% year on year, up from 6.7% in the previous month. Drastic action is required. At a monetary-policy meeting on Friday Russia’s central bank will probably raise interest rates by one percentage point, having raised them by two percentage points at the one before.

The [inflationary surge](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/10/vladimir-putin-is-running-russias-economy-dangerously-hot) has a simple explanation: fiscal policy. Vladimir Putin is sharply raising defence spending as he seeks to win the [war in Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/30/putin-seems-to-be-winning-the-war-in-ukraine-for-now). With an election in 2024, the government is also boosting welfare payments. This is running up against reduced supply, especially of labour. With plenty of outside options, workers are asking for much higher wages. Nominal pay is growing by about 15% year on year. The central bank wants Mr Putin to dial down the fiscal stimulus, but he is unlikely to listen. Do not be surprised if Russian inflation keeps moving upwards.

### China’s economic woes

Is [China’s economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/07/will-china-leave-behind-its-economic-woes-in-2024) poised for a triple dip? After the lockdowns of 2022, the country briefly rebounded in the early months of this year, only to suffer a second slowdown in the summer. A more forceful response from policymakers, including stronger fiscal easing, helped to revive growth in the autumn. But Ting Lu of Nomura, a bank, worries that this nascent recovery is already petering out. Imports and inflation were notably weak in November. Figures released on Friday are likely to show respectable year-on-year growth in retail sales and industrial production. But that is partly because November 2022 was such a bad month, providing a weak base for comparison.

After their Central Economic Work Conference, which sets the tone of policy for the year ahead, China’s policymakers hinted that they would make sure growth was robust before cracking down on lingering problems, like local-government debt. The government has already provided some stimulus. A triple dip would oblige it to redouble its efforts.

### A people’s assembly in Kyrgyzstan

On Friday around 700 delegates will gather in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan’s capital, for the first formal session of the “People’s Kurultai”. Taking its name from a traditional council of chieftains and khans, the kurultai will have elements of an old-fashioned popular assembly. But rather than organising itself, it will be convened by the country’s government.

Establishing a kurultai has long been an objective of Kyrgyzstan’s president, Sadyr Japarov, who [took power](https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/10/15/kyrgyzstans-president-resigns-as-a-recent-convict-takes-charge) following mass demonstrations in 2020. Soon after, he promised to deliver a vehicle for “popular control over the authorities”.

His opponents are sceptical. The selection process for delegates was opaque, and it is unclear exactly what powers the new assembly will hold. Critics fear the forum may be used to lend a veneer of democratic legitimacy to an increasingly centralised, illiberal administration. Mr Japarov recently tightened his grip on sources of dissent, including local media. He is unlikely to allow the People’s Kurultai a free hand.

### The state of American journalism

The *New York Times* is well placed to establish a common frame of debate in America. But like much of the country’s mainstream media, it is in the grip of an illiberal bias. In an [essay](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/12/14/when-the-new-york-times-lost-its-way) James Bennet, *The Economist’*s columnist on American politics, and a former opinion editor at the *Times*, argues that the newspaper’s pledge to pursue the news “without fear or favour” is no longer being honoured. He was asked to resign from the *Times* in 2020, after the publication of an op-ed by Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, caused a newsroom revolt.

This week *The Economist* [examines](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/14/can-you-have-a-healthy-democracy-without-a-common-set-of-facts) the state of the American media. Our package includes a [data analysis](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/14/american-journalism-sounds-much-more-democratic-than-republican) of over 600,000 pieces of journalism. It shows that the language of the mainstream media has drifted towards the Democratic Party’s preferred terminology and topics. That could lower its credibility among conservatives—and make it hard to heal the rifts in American politics ahead of next year’s presidential election.

### A smart satire of wokeness

“American Fiction” is a near-perfect debut film from Cord Jefferson, a writer-director, based on “Erasure”, a novel by Percival Everett. The protagonist is Thelonious Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), an author who happens to be black. But “the blackest thing [in his books] are the letters”. His literary fiction does not sate the market’s hunger for “raw”, “urgent”, “authentic” books about what it thinks black people to be.

With his career stalled and his family unravelling, Monk, as the character is known, needs a break. So he decides to pen a grotesque pastiche of stereotypical images of “black trauma porn” as a stunt. It quickly climbs to the tops of the charts, and cringeworthy hilarity and hypocrisy ensues. This plot makes for a cutting send-up of [wokeness](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/12/13/conservatives-are-trying-to-disrupt-hollywood-with-some-success) among the *bien-pensant* literary classes. And more ambitiously, it is a novelistic portrait of a complicated man and his dysfunctional family. In satirising how blackness is packaged and sold, the film itself offers a smart, sophisticated alternative.
