## The world in brief

### October 3, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Matt Gaetz**, a hardline Republican congressman, moved to oust **Kevin McCarthy** (pictured) from his position as speaker of America’s House of Representatives. The “motion to vacate”, or to call a vote to unseat the speaker, was expected: Mr Gaetz had promised to do so since Mr McCarthy called up a bill that [averted a government shutdown](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/01/by-averting-a-government-shutdown-kevin-mccarthy-risks-his-job) on Saturday. Lawmakers will probably vote on the motion within two days, as required by House rules.

America’s benchmark **ten-year government bond yield** rose to 4.7%, its highest rate since 2007. After the government averted a shutdown on Saturday, investors were strengthened in their expectation that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates “[higher for longer](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/forget-the-shutdown-americas-real-fiscal-worry-is-rising-bond-yields)”. The rising cost of federal borrowing is a growing problem for the American economy: the government will spend an estimated 2.5% of GDP on servicing its debts this year, double the share a decade ago.

At least 1,000 people have died from **dengue fever** in **Bangladesh** this year, with more than 200,000 confirmed cases, according to official figures. The death toll for 2023 is already higher than for 2000-22 combined. High temperatures and erratic rainfall—both consequences of climate change and the world’s current [El Niño](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/24/el-nino-and-global-warming-are-mixing-in-alarming-and-unpredictable-ways) weather pattern—exacerbate outbreaks of many mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue.

The **United Nations** authorised an international security mission to crack down on gang violence in **Haiti**. The force was approved by 13 of the UN Security Council’s 15 members (China and Russia abstained). Kenya, which will send about 1,000 police, will lead it. Gang violence has overwhelmed the Caribbean country, whose prime minister [requested foreign assistance](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/10/20/an-american-backed-foreign-force-may-be-sent-to-haiti) a year ago.

**Donald Trump** appeared in civil court for the opening of a trial in which he is accused of inflating his net worth. Before proceedings began, the former president, who denies wrongdoing, launched attacks against the prosecutor (“a horror show”) and judge (“rogue”). The court [already found](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/27/donald-trump-is-found-liable-for-fraud-in-his-real-estate-dealings) Mr Trump liable for fraud, but determined that several other alleged offences warranted a trial.

**Pakistan’s** annual inflation rate rose to 31.4% in September, up from 27.4% in August, driven by high fuel and energy prices. It is the highest level since the country secured a $3bn loan from the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/28/sri-lanka-shows-how-broken-debt-negotiations-have-become) in June. That deal was conditional on Pakistan agreeing to tough fiscal reforms, which are making the fight against inflation harder.

The **Nobel prize** in physiology or medicine was awarded to [Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/10/02/a-nobel-prize-in-physiology-for-mrna-vaccines), the pioneers of the [mRNA technology](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/03/27/covid-19-vaccines-have-alerted-the-world-to-the-power-of-rna-therapies) which led to the development of effective vaccines against covid-19. The scientists—who are Hungarian and American respectively—met in 1998 at the University of Pennsylvania, while making copies at a Xerox machine. They first published their groundbreaking research in 2005.

### The prosecution of crypto’s prodigal son

The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried begins in Manhattan on Tuesday. The jury must decide whether, as prosecutors allege, he misappropriated billions of dollars in a long-running scheme involving money laundering and multiple types of fraud. (He has pleaded not guilty on all counts.)

As the head of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, Mr Bankman-Fried appeared on the cover of *Forbes* and roamed the halls of Congress. But [FTX suddenly collapsed](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/17/the-failure-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-will-leave-deep-scars) last November, taking $8bn of customer money with it, when it became unable to fulfil a surge of withdrawal requests. The government’s evidence against him is extensive; he faces a maximum sentence of 110 years in prison.

The trial, expected to last around six weeks, will also place greater scrutiny on the cryptocurrency sector that canonised him. Mr Bankman-Fried's [downfall](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/17/what-sam-bankman-frieds-downfall-means-for-effective-altruism) and the pall it is casting over the cryptocurrency industry is not over yet: prosecutors have filed separate charges against him, including for allegedly bribing a Chinese official with $40m. (He pleaded not guilty.)

### Turkey is tired of inflation

After years of sitting on its hands and allowing inflation to approach triple digits, Turkey’s central bank [turned hawkish](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/01/turkeys-bizarre-economic-experiment-enters-a-new-phase) this summer. Soon after an [election](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/28/recep-tayyip-erdogan-is-re-elected-as-turkeys-president) that gave Recep Tayyip Erdogan another five years as president, the bank cracked down on inflation. Since June it has raised its benchmark rate by a cumulative 21.5 percentage points. But even this has not been enough to get ahead of inflation. Figures due on Tuesday are expected to show that it topped 60% in the year to September, up from 40% four months ago.

The latest wave of price increases results from the Turkish lira’s depreciation. The currency has lost nearly a third of its value against the dollar since the start of the year. Expect more devaluation and further interest-rate hikes. Turkey’s finance minister, Mehmet Simsek, has promised to do whatever it takes to slow prices, and urged patience. Turks have little left of it.

### Deterrence at work in the South China Sea

In the western Pacific, the American and Philippine navies will rehearse their ability to jointly go to war. The notional enemy in their war games, which begin in earnest on Tuesday, has not been identified. But [both countries](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/21/the-philippines-proximity-to-taiwan-makes-it-central-to-western-strategy) clearly oppose Chinese territorial ambitions in the region—as do Britain, Canada and Japan, which all have warships joining the exercises.

The Philippines and China are already sparring in the South China Sea. They have defended their overlapping claims with gestures rather than weapons. Last month, for example, Chinese forces set up a floating barrier to keep Filipino fishermen out of the area that China claims for itself. But international law gives the Philippines the right to fish there, too, so its forces responded by stealthily cutting the barrier from its moorings. Despite rising tensions, China is reluctant to escalate into the use of deadly force—especially as it watches the growing ability of the American, Philippine and other navies to fight cohesively, should they have to do so.

### Hunter Biden under scrutiny

In 2018 Hunter Biden bought a gun. Such a purchase requires completing a seven-page background form; lying on it is a felony. According to prosecutors, Joe Biden’s son did just that, declaring untruthfully that he was not addicted to drugs. On Tuesday Hunter will be arraigned on two counts of lying on federal firearms forms and one of owning a gun illegally. He is expected to plead not guilty.

The indictment follows a dramatic hearing in July, when an all-but-finalised plea deal between Hunter and the Justice Department collapsed in court. More charges may follow: Hunter is [also being investigated](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/12/13/what-are-the-allegations-against-hunter-biden) for failing to pay taxes.

Some Republicans insist that the lack of more serious charges against the “Biden crime family” (a Donald Trump term) evinces a “two-tiered justice system”. They argue that Hunter’s crummy business dealings enriched his father. Their scant evidence has not deterred them: in September they opened an [impeachment inquiry](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/11/hunter-bidens-woes-and-a-new-impeachment-saga-will-go-on-and-on) into the president.

### Hair braiding reaches Broadway

Broadway has come a long way since 2020, when a group of prominent black artists wrote a letter demanding more representation for non-white people and their stories. On Tuesday “JaJa’s African Hair Braiding”, a play with an all-black cast and mostly black creative leadership, opens at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre.

The 90-minute show takes the audience to a hot summer at a [hair-braiding](https://www.economist.com/films/2021/10/23/the-hidden-cost-of-black-hair) salon in Harlem. While honouring the west African tradition, the play also tells a broader tale about immigration and the American dream. That is in line with the playwright Jocelyn Bioh’s other Broadway offerings illustrating black experiences, such as “Nollywood Dreams” and “The African Mean Girls Play”. It is indicative of a wider trend, too. In the past two years Samuel L. Jackson starred in [August Wilson’s](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/25/august-wilson-was-and-remains-a-bard-of-black-life-in-america) “The Piano Lesson” and “The Phantom of the Opera” had its first black female lead. Broadway is trying to ensure that more black writers, directors and actors are treading its boards.
