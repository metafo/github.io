Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Israel** reached a deal to form a **unity government** as it prepares for an expected invasion of Gaza following the outbreak of war with Hamas, a militant group that controls the enclave. After days of delay, Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Benny Gantz, leader of the National Unity party and a former defence minister, also agreed to create a “war management cabinet” that would lead the country’s [military effort](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/brutal-urban-warfare-awaits-israels-army-in-gaza). Senior ministers will be appointed for the duration of [the war](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/08/the-lessons-from-hamass-assault-on-israel).

Fresh Israeli airstrikes hit **Gaza** on Wednesday. The enclave’s health ministry reported that at least 1,100 people had died since [Hamas](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/09/after-its-brutal-attack-hamas-is-calculating-its-next-move) launched a series of attacks—killing 1,200 people in Israel—on Saturday. **Electricity** was cut off after its only power station ran out of fuel. Israel has enforced a blockade of the Gaza Strip, cutting off external supplies. Authorities warned that the blackout would threaten “all basic life services” in what is one of the most densely populated areas in the world.

By a narrow margin **Republicans** elected **Steve Scalise**, a conservative congressman from Louisiana, to be their [party’s nominee](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/09/how-americas-house-of-representatives-will-choose-a-speaker) as speaker of America’s House of Representatives. Mr Scalise, the House majority leader, defeated Jim Jordan, a hardliner from Ohio, in a closed-door vote; the final tally was 113-99. To become speaker Mr Scalise will need to win 217 votes on the full House floor.

**ExxonMobil** agreed to buy **Pioneer Natural Resources**, a shale-oil giant, for $59.5bn. The Texan [supermajor’s](https://www.economist.com/business/what-is-exxonmobils-new-climate-strategy-worth/21807259) biggest-ever deal gives it a dominant presence in the Permian Basin—the mother lode of America’s shale boom. As the number of prime drilling sites dwindles analysts expect more consolidation among America’s fragmented [shale industry](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/07/10/the-mother-frackers-of-shale-now-resemble-opec).

**China** doubled its exports of electric vehicles in September, compared with a year earlier, shipping around 91,000 passenger cars abroad. Separately, China complained that the European Commission has given it insufficient time to engage in its [anti-subsidy probe](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/14/chinese-carmakers-are-under-scrutiny-in-europe), launched last month. The EU is considering tariffs to protect domestic carmakers from a “flood” of [cheaper Chinese EVs](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/04/14/cars-with-chinese-characteristics).

Robert Fico, leader of the leftist-populist party, Smer, signed a deal with smaller parties to form a coalition government in **Slovakia**, following his party’s [election win](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/01/slovakia-gives-pro-russian-populist-nationalism-another-win) on September 30th. The coalition will include Hlas, a left-wing party, and the nationalist, pro-Russia Slovak National Party. Mr Fico’s victory caused concern in NATO and the EU; he has said he will withdraw military support for Ukraine.

The Katmai National Park in southern Alaska has crowned **128 Grazer**—a skilled angler and feisty mother-bear of two litters—the winner of its [Fat Bear Week](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/04/alaskas-fat-bear-week-proves-conservation-can-be-joyful). The annual competition sees fans vote for the brown bear that they think has gained the most weight over the summer to prepare for hibernation. The niche contest for conservationists has a devoted global following.

### Hamas prepares for the invasion of Gaza

Israeli leaders have promised to “obliterate” Hamas, the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip. An [invasion](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/brutal-urban-warfare-awaits-israels-army-in-gaza) of the coastal enclave looks imminent, with Israeli troops massing on the border. But Hamas is also [preparing](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/09/after-its-brutal-attack-hamas-is-calculating-its-next-move)—and [claims](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/a-hamas-leader-refuses-to-admit-his-group-planned-to-kill-civilians) it can win a battle inside Gaza.

Israel’s forces are better equipped. But Hamas fighters know the terrain, and can hide in tunnels until soldiers leave. During an invasion in 2014 Hamas fighters battled for 50 days using small but heavily armed assault squads. And Hamas will hope that if the fighting exacts a steep humanitarian toll it will sway global public opinion against Israel and draw sympathisers into the fray.

The invasion would probably push to the coast to cut Gaza in two. But an Israeli re-occupation of Gaza looks implausible; it left in 2005 because it was so costly to hold. Keeping troops there would leave Israel short-staffed in the restive West Bank. And even if it were to succeed in smashing Hamas, it is unclear what might emerge in its place.

### Blinken travels to Israel

On Thursday Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, arrives in Israel in a show of solidarity. He will meet with senior Israeli officials to discuss how America [can continue to help](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/09/hamass-carnage-upends-joe-bidens-plans-for-the-middle-east), after President Joe Biden called Hamas’s attack “sheer evil” and pledged more aid on Tuesday. The two sides will also talk through hostage negotiations; Mr Biden has confirmed that Americans are among those held by Hamas in Gaza.

Meanwhile Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, will address his counterparts at a NATO summit in Brussels. The topic, ostensibly, is the geopolitical crisis that had outranked all others since February 2022: Ukraine. But Israel will be on everyone’s minds. Perhaps anticipating this, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, made a surprise trip to the summit to lobby in person for more weapons. But he reminded leaders that it will be important for Israel, as it was for Ukraine, “to not be alone”. Mr Zelensky, according to Axios, has requested to travel to Israel himself.

### The struggle to sell Bidenomics

For several months President Joe Biden has tried to sell Americans on his economic record. He will continue that pitch on Thursday when he is expected to meet a group of CEOs in the White House, and again on Friday during a visit to Philadelphia. The president likes to explain [Bidenomics](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/27/the-risks-of-bidenomics-go-beyond-inflation) as “growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up”—a rather woolly definition. In practical terms he has helped spur investments in infrastructure and clean energy, and has given strong backing to unions.

This should work to Mr Biden’s advantage with voters. Yet polls consistently show that most Americans think he has mismanaged the economy. Republicans characterise his economic record with a punchier term: Bidenflation. Although the inflation rate has decelerated recently, prices are up by nearly 20% since he took office less than three years ago. That is something all Americans can see.

### The zig-zagging price of oil

On Thursday the International Energy Agency, an official forecaster, releases its monthly report on global oil trends. It will be widely read. The oil price has been volatile in recent months: it is up by 21% since June, to $87 a barrel, but down by 10% since its peak in September of $97.

The market is caught between two contradictory forces. On the one hand there are fears that Iran, a top-ten oil producer, might be dragged into the [war between Israel and Hamas](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/brutal-urban-warfare-awaits-israels-army-in-gaza), becoming a target for Israeli air strikes. That could reduce petroleum supplies, which are already low because Saudi Arabia, hoping to raise prices, cut its output by 1m barrels a day in July.

But a big increase in the oil price would force central banks to keep interest rates high for longer than planned, restraining economic growth and thus demand for oil. So expect the price to keep zig-zagging: uncertain supply means that the market will move around a lot—but lacklustre demand will limit how high prices will go.

### NASA’s Psyche blasts off

On Thursday NASA, America’s space agency, will launch *Psyche*, a space probe that takes its name from its target: 16 Psyche, an asteroid that orbits the sun in the belt between Jupiter and Mars.

There has been a cluster of [asteroid missions](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/09/20/a-chunk-of-asteroid-is-coming-to-earth) in recent years. Some have dramatic aims, such as testing technologies designed to deflect asteroids that might be on a collision course with Earth. Yet Psyche 16 is of more academic interest. It is thought to be the remains of a proto-planet, which was left over from the formation of the solar system 4.6bn years ago and which lost its crust and mantle through collisions with other asteroids. Rocky planets, like Earth, typically have iron-rich cores. Sampling them is impossible. But if 16 Psyche really is the exposed core of a failed planet, it could help explain how the solar system’s quartet of rocky worlds—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—first formed.
