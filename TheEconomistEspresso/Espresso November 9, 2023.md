## The world in brief

### November 9, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**G7 foreign ministers** said that they support “humanitarian pauses and corridors” in **Gaza**, but did not call for a ceasefire. **Israel** extended an evacuation period from [Gaza city](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/mapping-the-destruction-in-gaza) after a “substantial response” to an initial four-hour window. Around 15,000 people fled from the north of the enclave during a similar pause in fighting on Tuesday. Earlier Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, said that “key elements” for peace include “no forcible displacement of Palestinians” and “no reoccupation” of Gaza by Israel.

The **European Commission** [recommended](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/08/ukraine-inches-closer-to-joining-the-eu) that formal accession talks should begin between the EU and Ukraine, pending the approval of member states. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the commission, said that the country has completed “well over” 90% of the necessary steps to join. But it will need to finalise reforms in areas such as anti-corruption and “de-oligarchisation” before negotiations begin.

America’s Food and Drug Administration approved a medication produced by **Eli Lilly**, a pharmaceutical firm, for weight-loss use. The injectable, called Zepbound, is part of a [new generation](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/03/02/a-new-class-of-drugs-for-weight-loss-could-end-obesity) of **obesity drugs**, and has the same active ingredient as Mounjaro, which is already approved to treat diabetes. It will [compete](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/28/pharmas-big-push-for-a-new-generation-of-obesity-drugs) against Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, the weight-loss version of Ozempic.

Shares in **Warner Bros Discovery** tumbled by more than 15% after the firm posted disappointing third-quarter results. Advertising revenue decreased by 12%, caused mainly by a drop in audience numbers. The company also warned investors that it is “unlikely” to meet its debt-payment goals, and said that there was a “real risk” that the [Hollywood strike](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/25/hollywoods-strike-enters-its-final-act-as-writers-reach-a-deal) would continue to hurt its finances.

A Republican-controlled congressional committee escalated its **impeachment inquiry** into **Joe Biden** by issuing subpoenas to [Hunter](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/12/13/what-are-the-allegations-against-hunter-biden) and James Biden, the president’s son and brother, and their business associate, Rob Walker. The House Oversight Committee is demanding their testimony as it tries to prove ([so far unsuccessfully](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/11/hunter-bidens-woes-and-a-new-impeachment-saga-will-go-on-and-on)) that Joe Biden corruptly profited from his son’s business dealings. The Biden administration dismissed the investigation as a “wild goose chase”.

Police in **Bangladesh** shot dead a [garment worker](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/01/bangladeshs-economic-miracle-is-in-jeopardy) during protests over pay on the outskirts of Dhaka, the capital. On Tuesday the government announced it would raise the minimum wage for garment-industry workers by 56%, the first such increase in five years. But workers—most of whom are women—are demanding close to three times their current wage. The industry accounts for 85% of Bangladesh’s annual exports.

Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, a pair of adult **pandas**, and their three-year-old cub, Xiao Qi Ji, left a zoo in Washington, DC, on their way to China. Pandas have lived in America’s capital since 1972, when [China](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/03/23/chinese-nationalists-are-up-in-arms-over-the-treatment-of-pandas) sent two as a gift to America to commemorate a visit by the then president, Richard Nixon. Some fear that the departure is symbolic of deteriorating Sino-American relations.

### America and China sit down together

On Thursday Janet Yellen, America’s treasury secretary, begins two days of talks with He Lifeng, China’s deputy prime minister in charge of economic policy. Their dialogue is expected to set the stage for a rare meeting between President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, next week. But Ms Yellen and Mr He also have [plenty to discuss](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/10/12/chinas-ties-with-america-are-warming-a-bit).

In a recent op-ed, Ms Yellen noted America’s “serious concerns with Beijing’s unfair economic practices.” She cited China’s “large-scale use of non-market tools, its barriers to market access and its coercive actions against US firms.” Meanwhile, officials in Beijing are unhappy with the Biden administration’s tight rules on investment by American firms in China. America is also diversifying critical supply chains away from the country. But Ms Yellen says [decoupling](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/08/how-america-is-failing-to-break-up-with-china) the world’s two biggest economies would be disastrous. On that point, at least, she and Mr He may agree.

### A Gaza aid conference in Paris

Europe has [struggled](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/the-eus-response-to-the-crisis-in-israel-exposes-its-limits) to make its diplomatic voice heard over the crisis in Gaza. On Thursday France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, hopes to draw attention to one subject where the EU has long played a role: humanitarian aid. He will host an “international humanitarian conference” on Gaza in Paris. It brings together NGOs and political figures including Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, as well as some from the region. No Israeli leader, however, is scheduled to attend.

The UN estimates that $1.2bn will be needed to meet Gaza’s urgent humanitarian needs. The focus in Paris will be on finance and logistics, given the [immense difficulty](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/29/as-the-gaza-war-rages-egypt-fears-for-its-stability) of getting aid into the enclave. One idea is to set up a maritime corridor for aid from Cyprus. France has sent a helicopter-carrier to the region, to be transformed into a floating hospital. The French hope to secure concrete operational results at the conference. In truth, that will be a hard task.

### A brutal turning point in Sudan

Much of the world is watching the unfolding battle for Gaza city. But in Sudan, where [fighting between two warlords](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/19/after-six-months-of-civil-war-little-remains-of-khartoum) has unleashed what the UN calls “one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history”, attention is focused on an impending showdown in the western region of Darfur. Fighters from the Rapid Support Forces, a rebellious paramilitary group that is trying to seize control of the country, recently mounted a lightning offensive. They are now set to take el-Fasher, the capital of the state of North Darfur, and with it the Sudanese army’s last significant garrison in the region.

Darfur’s fall would deal an enormous blow to the army—and expose civilians to the bloody retribution of the RSF and its allied militias. Horrific accounts of atrocities and sexual violence have emerged since the RSF took el-Geneina in West Darfur last week. Many warn [a genocide is under way](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/05/genocide-returns-to-darfur). There may soon be no force left to stop it.

### Can SoftBank rise again?

This week WeWork, an office-rental firm, [went bankrupt](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/07/the-fall-of-wework-shows-the-deepening-cracks-in-real-estate). Investors will closely watch the latest quarterly results from SoftBank, a Japanese venture-capital powerhouse with a majority stake in the business, released on Thursday.

As of last quarter SoftBank’s Vision Fund, famed for handing out cheques with little due diligence, had lost a cumulative $7.5bn since it launched in 2017. As tech valuations began slumping late last year, the firm’s financial health deteriorated. It has since sold assets, including shares in Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce giant, and [Arm](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/14/arms-successful-debut-may-signal-an-end-to-the-ipo-drought), a British chipmaker, to reduce debts and improve liquidity.

In June Son Masayoshi, SoftBank’s flamboyant founder, declared the firm was shifting back into “offence mode”, with its eyes on investments in artificial intelligence. Yet the market values the company at roughly one-third below the net value of the stakes it holds, suggesting investors remain wary of Mr Son’s investment style. The collapse of WeWork will do little to help that.

### “The Marvels” breaks new ground

Marvel Studios soared over Hollywood for a decade. A series of [interlinked blockbuster films](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/06/16/why-hollywood-is-obsessed-with-the-multiverse) about superheroes such as Iron Man and Captain America generated huge profits.

But after “Avengers: Endgame” made a record-breaking $2.8bn at the global box office in 2019, the company’s superpowers seemed to wane. Releases including “Black Widow”, “Eternals”, and “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” failed to take off, either critically or commercially.

Now comes “The Marvels”, an interstellar adventure starring Brie Larson. The first Marvel film to be directed by a black woman—Nia DaCosta, an American—it features two other female protagonists alongside Ms Larson’s character: one is played by a black American actress, Teyonah Parris, and another by a Pakistani-Canadian, Iman Vellani. The casting shows that the studio can still push boundaries. But this film seems unlikely to break box-office records. It is so overcomplicated that only obsessive Marvel fans will be able to follow the action.
