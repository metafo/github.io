## The world in brief

### January 20, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Iran’s** Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said an Israeli missile strike in **Damascus** had killed five of its members. They reportedly included a senior IRGC intelligence official. Five Syrians are also believed to have died in the blast. Israel has made no comment. Suspected Israeli strikes have recently killed an IRGC member near the Syrian capital as well as Hamas officials in Beirut.

Tens of thousands of people—50,000 in Hamburg alone—gathered in towns across Germany to protest against the hard-right **Alternative for Germany** party. The protests followed the revelation that late last year senior AfD members had discussed plans for the large-scale deportation of migrants. The AfD has just 78 of the Bundestag’s 736 seats, but polls suggest it is the country’s second-most popular party.

**Iran** said it had successfully launched a **satellite**, placing it in an orbit 750km above the Earth’s surface. The country’s space agency did not specify the satellite’s purpose. America has previously warned that Iran’s satellite launches breach a UN Security Council resolution and may hasten Iran’s ability to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles.

The speaker of the lower house of **Russia’s** parliament said lawmakers were preparing a bill to permit the confiscation of property from people spreading “deliberately false information” about the armed forces or calling for sanctions against the country. Vyacheslav Volodin said the bill—the latest element of a crackdown on criticism of Russia’s war in Ukraine—would be brought before the State Duma on Monday.

The Palestinian Red Crescent said **Israel** had fired on a hospital in Khan Younis, a city in southern **Gaza**, after the Israel Defence Forces launched an advance there. On Friday Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, spoke with Joe Biden for the first time in weeks. Mr Biden said afterwards that he did not consider [a two-state solution](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/12/07/despite-the-war-in-gaza-talk-of-a-two-state-solution-persists) between the Palestinians and Israelis impossible with Mr Netanyahu in charge—even though Israel’s leader had confirmed his opposition to Palestinian statehood only the day before.

Félix Tshisekedi was sworn in as president of **Congo** during a ceremony in the capital, Kinshasa. Mr Tshisekedi won a second five-year term last month after securing 73% of the vote. Nine opposition candidates, including the runner-up, Moïse Katumbi, rejected the [official result](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/04/a-thumping-win-for-tshisekedi-in-congos-election-raises-eyebrows) after the documenting of many cases of irregularities.

The **S&P 500** index of America’s big firms closed at an all-time high on Friday. A rally in shares in semiconductor companies, such as AMD and Nvidia, helped it to close at over 4,800 points, overtaking a previous record set in 2022. Tech optimism is up: TSMC, a Taiwanese chipmaker, reported strong demand for **AI** chips, lifting hopes for a bounce-back in smartphone and computing demand.

### A fiery campaign trail in Indonesia

Indonesia’s [presidential election](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-indonesia-election-tracker) takes place on February 14th. On Sunday three vice-presidential candidates will spar in a televised debate. They include Gibran Rakabuming Raka, son of the incumbent president, Joko Widodo (known as Jokowi). Under the constitution Mr Gibran is four years too young to run for the position. But last October the constitutional court controversially allowed his candidacy. (The court’s chief justice is Jokowi’s brother-in-law and Mr Gibran’s uncle.)

Also controversial is Prabowo Subianto, Mr Gibran’s running mate, who is the current front-runner for the presidency. A former army general, Mr Prabowo has been [associated with human-rights abuses](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/01/11/the-favourite-in-indonesias-presidential-election-has-a-sordid-past) during Indonesia’s brutal war in East Timor (he denies wrongdoing). He has an explosive temper: he recently lost his cool in a presidential debate when his two rivals questioned his record as defence minister, a role that Jokowi gave to him in 2019.

### A Global South get-together

Uganda is having a moment in the spotlight among developing countries. A meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement, a cold-war relic of countries [not formally aligned](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/04/11/how-to-survive-a-superpower-split) with any other major bloc, ended in Kampala, the capital, on Saturday. It was followed by a “South summit”, an economic get-together organised by the G77, a collection of poor and middle-income countries. Heads of state and government begin discussions on Sunday.

Both blocs were born in the era of decolonisation. They sought to reshape an international order they said was rigged in favour of the great powers. Their influence waned in the 1980s, as Latin America and Africa plunged into debt crises and the cold war approached its end. Still, [their members](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/13/can-the-west-win-over-the-rest) are home to most of the world’s population. And inside the UN, the G77 has been pushing for an international tax convention and a fund for countries affected by climate change. At the summit, the countries hope to boost co-operation in areas including trade, poverty eradication and digitalisation.

### Microplastics spreading in the wind

Every year in America 2.1m tonnes of sewage sludge is spread over the land as fertiliser. This fertiliser, called biosolids, is considered a good use of the waste, even though it contains the microplastics filtered out of waste-water. A new study in *Environmental Science & Technology Letters*, a journal, shows how the wind picks up those microplastic particles and spreads them as plastic dust.

Experiments conducted in wind tunnels reveal that microplastics are gathered up by the wind much more easily than soil. Even a gentle breeze can introduce them into the atmosphere because [microplastics](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/microplastics-in-household-dust-could-promote-antibiotic-resistance/21806204) are lighter and less “sticky” than ordinary dust. In tests, 84% of wind events picked up microplastics whereas only 23% picked up soil. That could mean more is floating around the air than previously thought. Little wonder, then, that microplastics have been found everywhere from mountain tops to the ocean floor—and inside human bodies. They may contribute to myriad conditions, from infertility to cancer.

### A cricketing challenge for England in India

This weekend the [England](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/08/how-grassroots-schemes-are-helping-englands-non-white-cricketers) men’s cricket team assembles in Hyderabad ahead of a five-Test series against India. In some roles the squad lacks experienced players. Shoaib Bashir, a 20-year-old spin-bowler, had played just six matches for his county side, Somerset, when the England coach, Brendon McCullum, selected him. England have struggled for years to produce international-quality spinners, partly because domestic pitches tend to suit faster bowling. In contrast, India’s 16-man squad for the first two matches of the series contains four spinners with 183 Test appearances between them.

England’s batting is also in focus. Under Mr McCullum they have pioneered an ultra-aggressive approach, known as “[Bazball](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/08/englands-bazball-revolution-could-change-test-cricket)”. It brought them a rare series win in Pakistan in 2022, when they broke records for the speed at which they piled up runs on pitches designed for slow scoring. Given the strength of the Indian side, a series win there would be an even bigger achievement.

### Weekend profile: Ram, beloved god and Hindu-nationalist icon

When the story of Ram was first told, believed to be thousands of years ago, few would have conceived that his birthplace would be the focal point of a battle between Hindus and Muslims in modern India. He was born as prince of Ayodhya in the north of the country. A prodigal child, he mastered the Hindu scriptures while excelling at archery and martial arts. Those skills helped him slay vicious demons who attacked his teacher. Later they were used to defeat scores of men in a competition to win the hand of Sita, a princess from the neighbouring kingdom. His exploits had a simple explanation: Ram was god incarnate, the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu.

That did not mean Ram would not suffer. A conspiracy instigated by his stepmother forced him into exile on the eve of his coronation as king. He was living frugally in the forests when the demon-king Ravana kidnapped his wife, Sita. But Ram triumphed. Helped by Hanuman, a monkey god, Ram vanquished Ravana in an epic battle, rescued Sita and returned to Ayodhya to be crowned. His reign, “Ram Rajya”, was a period of supreme peace, prosperity and joy. This mythical tale is sacred to Hindus and the cornerstone of much of Indian culture.

In modern India, Ram is revered because he embodied *dharma* (righteousness). But he has also been co-opted by politicians. Hindu nationalists see Ram as a symbol of cultural pride. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as a national force in the 1980s on the back of a campaign to bring down a mosque built on the spot in Ayodhya where Ram was believed to have been born. They planned to build a temple in its place. Egged on by the BJP’s leaders, a mob [razed the mosque](https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/11/09/the-supreme-court-hands-indias-biggest-communal-flashpoint-to-hindus) in 1992, triggering riots that killed 2,000 people.

On January 22nd, after years of legal wrangling and communal tension, [Narendra Modi](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/18/narendra-modis-illiberalism-may-imperil-indias-economic-progress), the BJP prime minister, will consecrate a lavish $220m Ram temple built on the rubble of the destroyed mosque. The grand ceremony will mark the high point of Mr Modi’s rule, during which Hindu radicals have been emboldened. Mob attacks on Muslims have been accompanied by chants of “Jai Shri Ram” (victory to Ram). While the new temple in Ayodhya pays homage to a beloved god, Mr Modi’s Hindu-nationalist project risks taking the country further away from “Ram Rajya”.
