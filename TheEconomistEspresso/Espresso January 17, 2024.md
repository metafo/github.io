## The world in brief

### January 17, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**America** launched new strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, hours after the militants claimed responsibility for striking a Greek-owned cargo ship in the **Red Sea**. The American attack reportedly targeted anti-ship missiles being readied for launch. Violence by the [Houthis](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/12/who-are-the-houthis-the-group-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea), an Iran-backed group that controls swathes of Yemen, is disrupting **global trade**. Volvo said it had halted production at its factory in Belgium after deliveries were delayed, while a company operating gas tankers for **Shell** said its ships were being diverted.

**Donald Trump** arrived at court in New York for a defamation case brought against him by E. Jean Carroll, a writer whom Mr Trump was found liable for sexually abusing last year. After the first day of the trial Mr Trump will travel to [New Hampshire](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/16/donald-trump-does-exactly-what-he-was-expected-to-do), a week ahead of its vote for the Republican nominee. On Monday Mr Trump won **Iowa’s** Republican caucus with around 50% of the vote.

A federal judge in America blocked **JetBlue’s** [takeover](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/28/the-spirit-deal-is-a-missed-opportunity-for-creative-destruction) of **Spirit Airlines**. The Biden administration sued last year to stop the $3.8bn deal, which the firms announced in July 2022, arguing that it violated antitrust laws and would “lead to fewer seats and higher prices”. Shares in Spirit, an ultra-low-cost carrier based in Florida, fell sharply on the news.

America’s Supreme Court refused to consider **Apple’s** appeal in an antitrust suit against its App Store. The decision paves the way for a ruling that would let developers direct iPhone users to cheaper purchasing options outside of Apple’s system. The [firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/14/apple-is-only-the-latest-casualty-of-the-sino-american-tech-war) charges developers a commission of up to 30% for digital goods and services sold through its App Store.

**Morgan Stanley’s** [profits ](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/16/ted-pick-takes-charge-of-morgan-stanley)fell by almost one-third year on year in the final quarter of 2023, owing to rising costs from its wealth-management business and a settlement with regulators over block trading. **Goldman Sachs** reported higher quarterly earnings thanks to the strong performance of its asset- and wealth-management divisions. Lower revenues from investment banking and trading dragged down profits.

**Polish truckers** said they will suspend their blockade of border crossings to Ukraine, after striking a deal with the government. Dariusz Klimczak, Poland’s infrastructure minister, said that the government would try to “implement everything requested” by the hauliers. They had been protesting against what they consider [unfair competition](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/04/27/a-spat-over-farming-bodes-ill-for-ukraines-future-european-prospects) from their Ukrainian counterparts caused by EU rule changes following Russia’s invasion.

Births in **France** plummeted to 678,000 last year, the lowest number recorded since the second world war. In contrast to many other European countries, France had long managed to keep births from collapsing. With an ageing population accustomed to [early retirement](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/03/09/france-is-in-a-stand-off-against-emmanuel-macrons-pension-reform), the country needs young people. However, the next generation to reach adulthood is a large one, meaning births may yet recover.

### China’s double decline

On Wednesday China’s government may reveal two notable declines in the country’s national heft. Its [population probably fell](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/01/17/for-the-first-time-since-the-1960s-chinas-population-is-shrinking) in 2023 for the second year running. And its economy may have shrunk in dollar terms.

After China hastily abandoned its covid-19 controls at the end of 2022, many people succumbed to the virus. One model estimates deaths at over 1.4m between December 2022 and February 2023. There may have been a comparable demographic swing at the other end of the life cycle: the number of births may have fallen to about 8m in 2023, from 9.56m in 2022, according to some analysts.

One reason is a lack of economic confidence. Today’s figures will probably confirm that GDP met the government’s growth target of about 5% in real terms. But [deflationary pressure](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/09/can-china-escape-deflation) will have depressed “nominal” GDP, which makes no adjustment for inflation. And the decline of the yuan may have left China’s dollar GDP a little smaller than a year earlier.

### India’s EV boom

India’s [economic growth](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/15/how-strong-is-indias-economy-under-narendra-modi) is especially visible on its roads. Data published last week showed that car sales grew by 7% in 2023, making India the world’s third-biggest market (behind America and China). Sales of [electric vehicles](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/04/20/forget-teslas-indias-ev-revolution-is-happening-on-two-wheels) are purring along especially rapidly. In the first nine months of 2023 they more than doubled, year on year.

The government is incentivising both producers and consumers of EVs. Narendra Modi, the prime minister, is courting Tesla, hoping to convince the American EV-maker to invest in India. Vinfast, a Vietnamese firm, plans to start selling electric two-wheelers and cars this year. And on Wednesday Tata Motors, the Indian market leader with 73% of electric-car sales, launches Punch, a compact electric SUV. Still, the government’s target for EVs to account for 30% of all car sales by 2030 looks a tall order.

### SCOTUS may reduce regulators’ powers

On Wednesday America’s Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in [two cases](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/11/the-us-supreme-court-is-primed-to-recalibrate-government-power) that could limit the authority of 436 federal agencies that handle everything from environmental regulation to air-traffic control. Both cases involve herring fisheries. They have filed suit against a rule issued in 2020 by the National Marine Fisheries Service that requires fishermen to foot the bill for an observer to join them on their boats.

The fishermen are questioning a Supreme Court decision—*Chevron USA v Natural Resources Defence Council*—which federal courts have relied upon for four decades to empower agencies to make such rules. *Chevron* instructs judges to defer to agencies’ understanding of ambiguous statutes, as long as their interpretations are reasonable.

Several conservative justices object to *Chevron*, including Neil Gorsuch, who says it amounts to “judicial abdication”. The high court has increasingly ignored *Chevron* as it has tightened oversight of regulatory agencies. The herring cases give the court a chance to bury it once and for all.

### What next for the IPCC?

On Wednesday delegates from 195 governments will continue a meeting in Istanbul to plan the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and summarises scientific guidance on the climate.

The IPCC influences how governments understand and respond to [climate change](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/01/10/2023-was-the-hottest-year-ever), not least because it outlines the future warming scenarios that inform policy. The body’s main output is “assessment reports”, published roughly every seven years. (The last came out between 2021 and 2023; the next could appear as early as 2028.) In the meantime, the IPCC will publish special reports on how higher temperatures affect cities and on how aerosols and methane affect the climate. What else the body chooses to focus on this cycle will guide how countries move their economies away from reliance on fossil fuels, which they promised to do at [COP28](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/12/13/climate-talks-at-last-lead-to-a-deal-on-cutting-fossil-fuel-use), the UN’s climate summit, in Dubai in December.

### “Mean Girls” becomes a musical

Hollywood’s franchises and sequels are not luring back to cinemas many of the people who stopped going during the pandemic. So now the industry is betting on remakes—with a twist. “Mean Girls” revisits the eponymous hit from 2004 about the travails of American high-schoolers. But there is a crucial change: the new film is a musical; its songs come from a stage adaptation.

The formula is becoming popular. “The Colour Purple”, released in America last month, is based on a musical adaptation of a novel by Alice Walker, as well as an earlier film version. This year will also see the release of the first part of “Wicked”—a movie based on the [musical-theatre](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/11/broadway-is-struggling-to-find-its-rhythm-after-the-pandemic) hit of the same name, itself a spin-off of the film “The Wizard of Oz” (which began as a book).

Yet the approach is not new. “The Producers” started as a film in 1967, became a theatrical musical and in turn became another movie in 2005. In Hollywood original ideas are few and far between.
