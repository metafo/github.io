## The world in brief

### December 29, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

The **Israel Defence Forces** said it “regrets the harm” caused by its air strikes on the **Maghazi** refugee camp on December 24th, which killed an estimated 86 people according to the UN. The IDF blamed the “extensive collateral damage” on incorrect munitions and said that their fighter jets had hit buildings next to their targets. Meanwhile on Thursday at least 50 people were killed in air strikes on Gaza, the territory’s health ministry said.

**Bulgaria** and **Romania** reached agreement with Austria to join the **Schengen area**, the EU’s passport-free travel zone, for journeys made by air and sea. Austria had been the sole Schengen member to object to the countries’ full accession, but softened its stance this month. The situation regarding trips made by land will be discussed again in 2024.

Nicolás Maduro, the president of **Venezuela**, ordered a military exercise after a British warship was deployed to visit **Guyana**, a British ally. Military leaders said 5,600 personnel could take part. Tensions have grown over Essequibo, an oil-rich Guyanese region [claimed by Venezuela](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/12/04/venezuelas-autocrat-nicolas-maduro-threatens-to-annex-guyana). Last month the two countries agreed to avoid the use of force; Mr Maduro said the warship breached the agreement’s spirit.

The General Confederation of Labour, a coalition of trade unions, announced a general strike in response to the economic reforms of [Javier Milei](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/11/23/javier-milei-will-be-argentinas-first-libertarian-president), **Argentina’s** president. Last week Mr Milei announced a [sweeping policy package](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/12/21/argentinas-javier-milei-begins-his-radical-experiment-in-libertarian-rule) that would open the door for privatisation of state companies, change workers’ conditions and weaken unions. The strike is scheduled for January 24th.

The leader of the [Rapid Support Forces](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/16/a-genocidal-militia-is-winning-the-war-in-sudan), a paramilitary group fighting the national army in **Sudan**, visited Ethiopia. Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, is visiting several east African countries. In Uganda days earlier he claimed he had put forward “our vision to engage in negotiations, cease hostilities and rebuild the Sudanese state based on new, just foundations”. Fighting between the RSF and the army has killed more than 12,000 people since April.

A court in **Hong Kong** sentenced three activists to up to six years’ imprisonment for their involvement in a foiled plot to bomb public buildings. Ho Yu-wang, Kwok Man-hei and Cheung Ho-yeung were charged with “conspiracy to commit terrorism” or “conspiracy to cause explosions” under the terms of the national-security law that was imposed on the territory in 2020 by the Chinese government.

**Xiaomi**, a Chinese smartphone-maker, unveiled its first electric car. The company is setting great store by the SU7 sedan, even though overcapacity in [China’s electric-car market](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/12/07/china-and-the-eu-risk-a-trade-war) leaves doubts about domestic demand. At the unveiling its founder and CEO, Lei Jun, spoke of plans to make Xiaomi one of the world’s top five electric-vehicle companies within 20 years.

### 2024 in preview: Moon missions are back

Next year NASA astronauts are due to [return to the Moon](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/astronauts-are-returning-to-the-moonwell-sort-of). Well, sort of. Four astronauts—Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Hammock Koch and Jeremy Hansen—will travel 7,400km beyond the Moon, swing around and return to Earth, without landing on the lunar surface. They will be the first humans to reach the vicinity of the Moon since those of Apollo 17 in 1972.

It will be a thrilling year for space exploration. China will try to deliver another robotic lander to the Moon and Japan will launch its Martian Moons Exploration mission. NASA plans to launch *Europa Clipper*, a probe dedicated to studying the habitability of one of Jupiter’s moons, and the Indian Space Research Organisation aims to kick off its *Shukrayaan* mission to Venus. Private companies will also test new, reusable rockets, the most impressive of which is SpaceX’s *Starship*, which should manage to put 150 tonnes into orbit. Expect to see more trials of that behemoth in 2024.

### 2024 in preview: Smaller, better, faster, stronger AI

What to expect from AI in 2024? As large language models (LLMs) become commercial commodities, there is a growing focus on making them [smaller and faster](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/ai-models-will-become-smaller-and-faster). Small models, which can be squeezed onto fewer chips, are much less expensive to train and to run—some can even run on a laptop or smartphone.

Developers have been training smaller models with more training data. For instance, “Chinchilla”, an LLM developed in 2022 by Google DeepMind, outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-3, despite being a quarter of the size: it was trained on four times the data. Focus is also shifting from “how much” data to “how good”, as stocks of new, high-quality text are expected to gradually dry up.

A bigger advance, however, will be in learning how to use them better. To enhance the accuracy of responses, for example, LLMs can be combined with extra software and a specialised database of knowledge. Showing what is possible has turned into figuring out what is practical.

### 2024 in preview: Watch out for CRISPR

[Gene-edited drugs](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/new-medical-treatments-will-use-genetic-scissors-and-other-clever-tricks) will make headlines in 2024. The first CRISPR drug, exa-cel, which made its historic arrival in late 2023, will treat sickle-cell disease and beta thalassaemia, two genetic blood disorders. CRISPR is a gene-editing technique that precisely cuts and edits DNA. The therapy, developed by Crispr Therapeutics and Vertex, edits stem cells extracted from a patient’s body. When returned, the edited cells counteract the genetic defect. The treatment is said to last a lifetime. But these drugs will cost more than $2m per patient, and for many around the world they will be impossible to obtain.

The coming year will also see progress in gene-editing technology towards off-the-shelf treatments for cancer and diabetes. The workhorse of the immune system, the T-cell, can be gathered from donors and reprogrammed via gene-editing to fight cancer without triggering an immune rejection by the patient’s body. Similar technology could help diabetics by creating replacement insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

### 2024 in preview: More success for weight-loss drugs

After decades of disappointing weight-loss treatments, the arrival of safe and effective drugs is a milestone. Some now talk of a future without obesity. That is no small claim: obesity affects 1.1bn people, or roughly 14% of the world’s population. In 2024 Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, two pharma giants, will [battle for dominance](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/expect-a-bumper-year-for-weight-loss-drugs) of what could be a $77bn market by 2030, through their drugs Wegovy (semaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide).

More treatments are coming. Most are based on the same idea: glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, which keep people fuller for longer. They also affect the brain’s hypothalamus, which controls hunger, and may make fat more likely to break down. The catch is that you have to keep taking them. Eventually, though, taking obesity drugs every day may become widely accepted—especially if, as a recent paper suggested, they could reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as strokes and heart attacks, by 20%.
