Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

------

**Hong Kong** passed [Article 23](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/01/31/hong-kong-gets-a-second-draconian-security-law), a draconian law which ostensibly cracks down on “external interference” but is likely to further stifle all forms of internal dissent. It builds upon a controversial [national security law](https://www.economist.com/interactive/essay/2022/07/01/how-hong-kong-became-a-police-state) which was imposed on the city by China’s government in 2020. The new legislation was rushed through Hong Kong’s parliament in less than two weeks.

America’s Supreme Court gave **Texas** permission to enforce a [controversial law](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/25/the-bold-texas-plan-to-stop-migrants-has-hit-a-wall) while a lower court considers its legality. The law allows state police to arrest suspected **illegal migrants**, powers that the Biden administration argues are reserved for the federal government. In an emergency ruling, the court voted along ideological lines, with one liberal justice warning the law would “sow chaos”.

**Microsoft**, an American tech giant, hired **Mustafa Suleyman** to lead a new unit focused on incorporating artificial intelligence in consumer software. (Mr Suleyman sits on the board of *The Economist*’s parent company.) The tech behemoth will also hire most of the staff of Inflection, an AI company run by Mr Suleyman. Microsoft recently overtook Apple as [the world’s most valuable company](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/17/just-how-rich-are-businesses-getting-in-the-ai-gold-rush), partly owing to its [bet on AI](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/27/how-microsoft-could-supplant-apple-as-the-worlds-most-valuable-firm).

Rachel Reeves, **Britain’s** shadow chancellor, said that Labour would deliver a “course correction” in a speech she gave outlining the opposition party’s **economic plans**. Emphasising discipline, she said the party would borrow only in order to invest. Last month the party [cut back](https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/02/08/britains-labour-party-cuts-back-its-flagship-climate-change-policy) its proposed flagship (and expensive) climate-change policy. Polls [overwhelmingly favour](https://www.economist.com/interactive/uk-general-election/polls) a Labour win in a general election due this year.

**German** prosecutors charged an officer in the military procurement agency with [spying](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/06/the-damage-done-by-russias-hack-of-germanys-defence-ministry) for **Russia**, identifying him only as Thomas H. He worked for a department which handles some of the most sensitive information regarding Germany’s military arsenal. Earlier Boris Pistorius, the country’s defence minister, announced a €500m ($540m) aid package for Ukraine and promised that Germany would join a Czech-led initiative to increase supplies of ammunition.

**Brazil’s** federal police accused **Jair Bolsonaro** of falsifying a covid-19 vaccine card. The former president, a noted vaccine sceptic, travelled to America after he left office in 2022, when the country required proof of a jab to enter. He could face prison time if prosecutors pursue the case. Several investigations, including whether he [conspired to stage a coup](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/09/supporters-of-jair-bolsonaro-mount-an-insurrection-in-brazil) after losing the election, remain under way.

**Intermittent fasting** was never for the faint-hearted. Now the American Heart Association has published research showing that [restricting eating](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/01/22/the-art-of-fasting) to an eight-hour window each day—a popular weight-loss strategy—may raise the risk of dying from heart disease by 91%. The study, which has not yet been published in full, looked at more than 20,000 adults in America.

**Figure of the day:** 257%. The rise in the number of abortions carried out in New Mexico since 2020. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/19/fewer-states-allow-abortions-yet-american-women-are-having-more).

### The Fed provides clarity

Start with what is all but certain: at its meeting on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged. But beyond that, [investors](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/24/investors-may-be-getting-the-federal-reserve-wrong-again) around the world will be on tenterhooks. One question is how Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, describes price trends. Inflation has turned up in recent months, which could delay the onset of rate cuts. But Mr Powell may suggest that the Fed is still on track to cut rates in June, as most investors currently expect.

A second focus will be on the Fed’s quarterly outlook. In December [the central bank indicated](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/13/the-fed-gives-in-to-the-clamour-for-looser-money) that it would make three-quarter-point rate cuts this year. The debate now is whether it may signal somewhat less easing or project that short-term rates will settle at a higher level in the long run than previously thought. This would reflect a belief that the economy may require slightly tighter policy conditions on an ongoing basis to avoid overheating.

### Australia’s tricky truce with China

China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, visits Australia on Wednesday for meetings with his counterpart, Penny Wong, and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. This is Mr Wang’s first trip down under since 2017. Relations later soured. Australia banned Huawei from its 5G network and demanded an inquiry into the origins of covid. China responded by restricting imports of Australian goods.

But Mr Albanese of the centre-left Labor Party, in office since 2022, has sought to [improve relations](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/07/australia-and-china-patch-things-up). China has lifted most of the trade restrictions. It is expected to end high tariffs on wine this month. But debate rages in Australia about how friendly it should be with China. In February its top spy said that a former politician [had been recruited](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/03/14/an-australian-spy-chief-triggers-a-debate-about-china) by a Chinese espionage ring. Mr Wang will encourage pro-China sentiment by meeting Paul Keating, a former Labor prime minister who criticises Australia’s “anti-China” stance and its alliance with America. China is no longer [bullying](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/02/15/australia-needs-to-rethink-its-approach-to-its-pacific-island-neighbours) Australia, but it hopes to exploit its divisions.

### The game is on for Tencent

China’s massive consumer-oriented internet companies have had a [rough few years](https://www.economist.com/what-tencents-rebound-says-about-prospects-for-chinas-big-tech). But there are signs that the biggest of the bunch, Tencent, is making a comeback. In November the group, which is based in the southern city of Shenzhen, reported higher-than-expected revenues from advertising and international gaming. On Wednesday it may deliver another pleasant surprise when it reports its fourth-quarter earnings.

Even if the figures round off 2023 nicely, there are big concerns for the year ahead. A large chunk of Tencent’s business is based on processing online payments. China’s dreary economic outlook may continue to hurt consumer spending, constraining the group’s income. Another threat could come from overseas. Chinese internet companies, such as TikTok, are coming under fire in America. That has not yet hurt Tencent’s sales of games to customers abroad, an important source of its growth. But it should be a source of anxiety for the company.

### BioNTech looks beyond covid

The German biotech firm that developed the world’s first covid vaccine (with Pfizer, an American pharma giant) reports its annual results on Wednesday. BioNTech’s sales have fallen because demand for covid jabs is [waning](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/08/10/after-a-covid-fuelled-adrenaline-rush-biotech-is-crashing). In 2024 it expects revenues of $3.28bn, about a quarter less than last year. The company’s market value has fallen by more than 75% from its peak in August 2021.

BioNTech is exploring ways of using [mRNA technology](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/03/27/covid-19-vaccines-have-alerted-the-world-to-the-power-of-rna-therapies), the basis of the vaccines, to treat other diseases. In April it will share data from clinical trials of its cancer therapies at the annual gathering of the American Association for Cancer Research. These include a vaccine targeting non-small cell lung cancer and therapy for pancreatic cancer.

Although most of its non-covid treatments are still in their early stages of development, good results from the trials would give investors–and patients–hope.

### Past is prologue at the Whitney Biennial

In the art world fortunes are made by [galleries](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/03/13/maastricht-is-where-museums-go-on-shopping-sprees) and auction houses. But reputations are made by museums, particularly in marquee shows like the Whitney Biennial. The 81st exhibition opens on Wednesday in New York.

Every two years the show makes an argument about what is most important in American art. This year’s offering, subtitled “Even Better than the Real Thing”, promises to grapple with AI and contemporary conversations about gender and sexuality. But only two works (by an artistic duo) explicitly engage with AI and little new is said about identity. Strikingly, current events—from Ukraine to Gaza to the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump—go virtually unmentioned. The biennial looks less like the future, and more like the past.

But there is excellence, too—particularly a room-sized installation by Suzanne Jackson, an American artist. Wraithlike sheets of painted acrylic hang from masts like limp sails and will deform with gravity. Ms Jackson is literally stretching the tradition of painting in new ways.
