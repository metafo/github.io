## The world in brief

### October 5, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



The **EU** sealed a deal to overhaul its **migration** system after Germany and Italy resolved a row over the role of NGOs in the Mediterranean. The [agreement](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/15/why-europes-asylum-policy-desperately-needs-rebooting) will serve as the basis for further negotiations between member states and the European Parliament to create new laws. Under the deal, pushed through over the objections of some countries, border countries will be able to speed up asylum procedures and ask for assistance from other countries, who will also have to accept a quota of migrants, or pay into a joint fund.

A **global bonds sell-off** pushed borrowing costs to [multi-year highs](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/forget-the-shutdown-americas-real-fiscal-worry-is-rising-bond-yields) in several countries as investors prepared for a prolonged period of tight monetary policy. American 30-year Treasury yields shot above 5% for the first time since 2007, and German ten-year yields passed 3%, their highest since 2011. Meanwhile the Bank of Japan battled to maintain its policy of [yield-curve control](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/04/how-japanese-policymakers-ended-up-in-a-very-deep-hole) with an emergency bond purchase.

**Russia** appears to have moved most of its Black Sea fleet from its principal base in Crimea to safer ports. The withdrawal follows weeks of [ramped up](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/25/war-has-arrived-in-crimea) Ukrainian attacks, resulting in the fleet’s “functional defeat”, according to James Heappey, a British junior defence minister. Earlier **Russia’s** defence ministry said that its air defences shot down 31 Ukrainian drones in an overnight attack.

**Health-care workers** started their largest-ever strike in **America**, demanding better pay and [higher staffing levels](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/09/22/americas-missing-doctors). Around 75,000 employees of Kaiser Permanente, a large medical provider, walked out for three days beginning on Wednesday after negotiations with the company collapsed. Kaiser Permanente said that it was hiring temporary workers to keep its hospitals open.

Two **Republican** congressmen entered the race to become speaker of America’s House of Representatives, a day after **Kevin McCarthy** was [ousted](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/04/kevin-mccarthys-sacking-deepens-the-chaos-in-american-government) from the role. Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise will vie for the speakership; others are expected to announce bids before October 11th, when a House-wide vote could be held. Mr McCarthy’s exit, resulting from a vote forced by fellow Republican Matt Gaetz, has thrown the House into turmoil.

The **Nobel prize** **for chemistry** was awarded for the “discovery and synthesis of quantum dots”, minuscule particles with special optical and electronic properties. They are used in medicine to guide surgeons and improve the targeting of cancer drugs, and for the manufacture of solar panels and television sets. The recipients were Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov—French, American and Russian scientists, respectively, all working in America.

**FIFA** awarded the hosting of the **2030 World Cup** to **Morocco, Portugal** and **Spain**. But to mark the centenary of the tournament, the opening three matches will be played in Uruguay (the host and winner of the first competition), Argentina (the first runners-up) and Paraguay (home to the South American Football Confederation). Countries from Asia and Oceania can now start putting forward their bids for the 2034 event.

### Welcome to homeland economics

On Thursday Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the IMF, will deliver a speech ahead of her institution’s annual meetings next week, to be held in conjunction with the World Bank. The delegates will probably be feeling quietly satisfied with the world economy’s continued growth. A year ago, in the middle of an energy crisis provoked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, many economists had expected a deep global recession in 2023. Now real GDP growth of about 3% looks likely. That is not strong, but it is not awful.

Meanwhile, the contours of a new global economic architecture are becoming clear. As *The Economist* reports in a [special report](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/10/02/governments-across-the-world-are-discovering-homeland-economics) this week, “homeland economics” is guiding policy across the world. Governments are increasingly sceptical about the benefits of free trade and investment. They are seeking instead to build up “[domestic resilience](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/10/02/attempts-to-make-supply-chains-resilient-are-likely-to-fail)” through massive use of [protectionism](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/10/02/green-protectionism-comes-with-big-risks) and subsidies. This new approach is likely to be [very costly](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/10/02/homeland-economics-will-make-the-world-poorer). Although things may look decent today, dangers lie ahead.

### Penny-pinching on climate solidarity

COP15, the United Nations climate-change conference held in Copenhagen in 2009, was widely regarded as a disaster. Talks ended in disagreement and disarray. The main bright spot was the promise of a global Green Climate Fund—a piggy bank into which rich countries would pay to help poor ones cope with rising temperatures. Officially adopted in 2011, the GCF set a goal of raising $100bn a year by 2020.

It is still not getting that amount. But the ambition (or pretence that the goal will be met) persists. On Thursday government delegates will attend a “high-level pledging conference” in Bonn, Germany, where they are meant to cough up the cash for the next cycle, running from 2024 to 2027. Fourteen countries have already made commitments. The most generous are Germany ($2.1bn), Britain ($2bn) and France (almost $1.7bn). America, Australia and Japan have yet to pledge any money. Poor countries, long angry about rich countries shirking their [promises](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/27/the-choice-between-a-poorer-today-and-a-hotter-tomorrow), will be paying close attention.

### War without jaw-jaw in Nagorno-Karabakh

The European Political Community summit, a gathering of nearly 50 heads of government in Spain to take place on Thursday, was supposed to be a chance for the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia to meet. The proposed tête-à-tête would have been the first since Azerbaijan seized control last month of [Nagorno-Karabakh](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/22/renewed-fighting-in-the-caucasus-shows-russias-waning-influence), a separatist Armenian enclave inside its own borders. But at the last minute Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, cancelled his trip.

Azerbaijan’s military takeover of Nagorno-Karabakh prompted some 100,000 people, nearly the entire population of the region, to [flee to Armenia](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/a-humanitarian-disaster-is-under-way-in-nagorno-karabakh). Optimists hope that the end of Armenian control over Karabakh might pave the way for a comprehensive peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But Mr Aliyev’s absence from Granada dampens those hopes. He and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an ally, have mused about linking their countries with a land corridor through southern Armenia itself. This could be the start of another, potentially violent, dispute.

### India hosts the cricket World Cup

When India first hosted the Cricket World Cup alongside Pakistan in 1987, organisers had to scrounge for sponsors. They eventually persuaded Reliance Industries, then a textiles company, now a giant conglomerate. Today sponsors are desperate to get involved in the sport’s biggest international contest. When the World Cup [returns to India](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/10/04/narendra-modi-has-seized-and-politicised-indian-cricket) for the fourth time on Thursday, the competition will have 18 sponsors.

The list, which includes homegrown [edtech](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/02/19/can-the-ed-tech-boom-last) and fintech firms, reflects the tremendous growth of both cricket and India’s economy in recent decades. Some things though, remain the same. India’s leaders have long used the [country’s favourite pastime](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/31/the-indian-premier-league-is-taking-over-global-cricket) as a political tool. This year—six months before a general election—politics will be more visible than ever before. The opening match of the tournament and the final will be played in a 130,000-seat stadium named after Narendra Modi, the prime minister. Seeking a third term in office, Mr Modi hopes that success on the cricket pitch will help him win at the ballot box.

### Latin music’s global explosion

[Bad Bunny](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/05/29/bad-bunny-a-superstar-rapper-is-good-business), a Puerto Rican rapper, can expect a warm welcome at the Billboard Latin Music Awards in Florida on Thursday. The Sunshine State is home to around 5.5m Hispanic people—a fast-growing group that devours Spanish-language music. Last year they helped propel Bad Bunny’s release, “Un Verano Sin Ti”, to the top of America’s charts—only the second non-English album to reach those heights (the first was also his).

The Puerto Rican has been the most-streamed artist on Spotify for three years running and is leading a new wildly popular wave of Latin music. Other stars include Peso Pluma, the most-nominated artist at Billboard’s awards. The Mexican, who has sung about “El Chapo”, a drug lord, recently out-charted Bad Bunny on YouTube.

Their success is driven partly by the rise of streaming in Latin America, where half a billion people own a mobile phone. English-language music will not lose its global prominence yet, but it has a challenger.
