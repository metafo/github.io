### December 19, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Lloyd Austin**, America’s defence secretary, said he would not “dictate timelines or terms” for **Israel’s** [war in Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/10/israel-has-just-a-few-weeks-left-to-destroy-hamas) after a meeting with the country’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and other senior officials. But Mr Austin emphasised the need to “transition from higher intensity operations to lower intensity operations”. His comments reflect growing international pressure on Israel to reduce civilian casualties. Earlier on Monday Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said that 19,453 people have been killed by Israeli attacks since October 7th.

**BP**, a British oil company, said it will pause all shipments through the **Red Sea** after the **Houthis**, an Iran-backed [militant group](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/12/who-are-the-houthis-the-group-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea), stepped up attacks on the shipping lane. Oil futures climbed following the announcement, which comes after several shipping giants paused traffic along the route. America and its allies reportedly plan to deploy a new maritime force to secure the waterway, a vital artery for world trade.

**Nippon Steel**, a Japanese steel-maker, reached an all-cash deal to buy **US Steel** for more than $14bn. The $55 share price was significantly higher than the $35 [offered by rival Cleveland-Cliffs](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/08/24/americas-steelmakers-forge-a-future-together) in a cash-and-stock bid in August. However the United Steelworkers union, which represents most US Steel workers and favours a domestic, unionised owner, said the deal demonstrated a “greedy, shortsighted attitude”.

**Texas’s** governor signed a law criminalising **immigration** through unofficial ports of entry, setting up an inevitable legal showdown. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that the federal government—not states—control immigration. Texas, however, has funded its [own border-enforcement programme](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/04/the-biden-administration-is-quietly-completing-bits-of-donald-trumps-wall) for over two years. The new law, set to take effect in March, would allow local or state police to arrest alleged offenders.

**Apple** will “preemptively” stop selling two models of its smartwatch ahead of a ban due to take effect on December 26th because of a patent violation. In October America’s International Trade Commission said that the watches’ blood-oxygen sensors violated patents owned by Masimo, a medical-device maker; Apple requested the Biden administration review the decision. It could veto the ban up to December 25th.

The **EU** adopted a new package of **sanctions** against **Russia**. The measures impose a ban on imports of Russian diamonds to the bloc from the beginning of 2024, as well as restrictions on some metals. The package also tightens the **G7** oil “[price cap](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/06/a-higher-global-oil-price-will-help-russia-pay-for-its-war)” after widespread circumvention meant that Russia could sell crude for well over the $60-a-barrel limit.

**Pope Francis** gave approval for Catholic priests to bless **same-sex couples**, marking a significant shift in church doctrine. In a document published on Monday, the Vatican announced that such blessings may be offered provided they are not carried out as part of a civil union. Blessings, it said, should not require “an exhaustive moral analysis” before they can be given.

### 2023 in review: Teflon Trump comes roaring back

*This week, we are looking back on 2023. Today, politics*

After the 2022 midterm elections, American politics appeared ready for a reset in 2023. President Joe Biden defied expectations by holding the Senate and only narrowly losing the House of Representatives. His fellow Democrats, once worried about the ageing and unpopular president, in effect crowned him their party’s nominee, convinced his strategy of tarring Republican candidates as “MAGA extremists” could work again at the presidential poll in 2024.

In 2023, however, Donald Trump came back out fighting. For a brief time, Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, appeared a [plausible challenger](https://www.economist.com/films/2023/05/24/can-ron-desantis-beat-donald-trump) for the Republican nomination. But his poll numbers [slipped](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/30/ron-desantiss-lurch-in-florida-hurts-his-presidential-chances), leaving [little](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-republican-primaries-tracker) in the former president’s path. With every indictment Mr Trump has grown more popular with the Republican base, and is coasting towards the GOP nomination.

Even chaos on Capitol Hill—where a Republican speaker of the House of Representatives did not survive the year—did not stop the Trump surge.

### 2023 in review: China’s rocky year

*This week, we are looking back on 2023. Today, politics*

The start of [Xi Jinping’s](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/11/16/xi-jinping-repeats-imperial-chinas-mistakes) third five-year term as Communist Party chief has been rocky. Soon after he secured this extension, late in 2022, rare protests broke out over his draconian “zero-covid” policy. The subsequent hasty abandonment of that strategy caused a surge of deaths. Furthermore, the economy unexpectedly failed to regain its usual vigour. The property market faltered, while local governments struggled under mountains of debt. China’s ever-murky politics also took an unusual turn, with the publicly unexplained purges of the foreign minister and defence minister less than a year after their appointments. At the end of 2023, observers were further puzzled by the Communist Party’s failure to convene a long-anticipated gathering of the ruling elite to discuss the economy.

Meanwhile, tensions with America flared following America’s shooting-down of a Chinese [spy balloon](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/09/tensions-will-linger-over-a-chinese-balloon-downed-by-america) in February. [A meeting](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/11/16/joe-biden-and-xi-jinping-rediscover-the-joy-of-talking-good) in November between Mr Xi and President Joe Biden—their first in a year—offered some relief. But it may not last long.

### 2023 in review: Gain and loss for the hard-right in Europe

*This week, we are looking back on 2023. Today, politics*

Europeans began the year relieved that the gas shortage linked to the war in Ukraine did not result in citizens freezing. The chill nonetheless caught up with them as the conflict continued with no end in sight. Supporting Ukraine occupied many an EU summit, until, finally, at the last such one of the year the bloc agreed to open formal [accession talks](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/14/ukraine-takes-an-important-step-towards-eu-membership) with the beleaguered country, and tiny Moldova, also threatened by Russia. The EU also granted candidate status to Georgia.

Several elections were framed by whether the populist hard-right would turn from disruptive opposition to holders of high office. Results were mixed. In Spain a right-wing alliance featuring the populist Vox party surprisingly [failed to gain power](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/26/spain-shows-that-some-voters-still-want-centrism) in July, while [in Poland](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/15/poland-gives-pro-european-liberals-a-big-win) the illiberal Law and Justice party was turfed out after eight years in government. But the biggest surprise was when [Geert Wilders](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/25/geert-wilderss-dutch-election-win-is-a-headache-for-europe), a Muslim-baiting firebrand, came top in Dutch elections on November 22nd. His future role—perhaps as prime minister—will be a matter for 2024.

### 2023 in review: The new politics of the Middle East

*This week, we are looking back on 2023. Today, politics*

At the start of 2023 many observers thought the [Israeli-Palestinian conflict](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/10/18/a-short-history-of-the-arab-israeli-conflict), a totemic issue in the Arab world, had faded into irrelevance. No longer. The Gaza war has scrambled the region’s politics, forcing Arab leaders to cool their warming ties with Israel and widening the gap between publics and palaces. For the Saudis, normalisation with Israel will have to wait: they will demand a higher price to establish relations. Egypt and Jordan will start the new year nervous. Their populations are already angry about miserable economies, and the Palestinian plight has a way of mobilising people.

Yet some of the changes are overstated. Gulf states will not sever ties with Israel, nor the détente with Iran they forged in early 2023. Iran is flexing its muscles abroad, but its system is still [rotting from within](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/14/irans-regime-is-weaker-than-it-looks-and-therefore-more-pliable). The Palestinian cause is back on the agenda—but in a region that has changed in myriad ways.
