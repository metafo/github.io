Thousands of civilians fled Khartoum, the capital of **Sudan**, as [fighting continued](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/16/khartoum-has-exploded-into-open-warfare) for a fifth day between the country’s ruling military junta and the Rapid Support Forces, a militia. On Tuesday a 24-hour [“ceasefire” was broken ](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/19/in-sudan-and-beyond-the-trend-towards-global-peace-has-been-reversed)with both sides blaming the other. At least 270 civilians have been killed and more than 2,600 injured in the fighting. António Guterres, the UN’s secretary-general, warned that the humanitarian situation had become “catastrophic”.

**Tesla** reported that first-quarter net income fell by 24% year over year, to $2.5bn. Revenues rose by the same pace, hitting $23.3bn. The [electric-vehicle firm](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/04/14/an-electric-shock) has cut prices six times this year to juice demand, denting profitability. Indeed operating margins fell to 11.4% from 19.2% in the same period last year.

**Morgan Stanley** reported first-quarter profits of $2.98bn, a 19% fall compared with a year earlier, amid a slowdown in dealmaking. The [Wall Street bank](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/01/26/how-goldman-sachs-went-from-apex-predator-to-wall-street-laggard) also had to almost quadruple its provisions for potential loan losses to $234m. However, the firm’s wealth-management division increased revenues by 11% year over year, to $6.6bn, and added $110bn in new assets.

**Ukraine** announced it had received its first **Patriots**, the West’s [most advanced](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/24/patriots-promise-ukraine-its-first-defence-against-ultra-fast-russian-missiles) missile- and air-defence system, from America, Germany and the Netherlands. On Wednesday morning, Ukraine said Russia had launched 60 air strikes in the previous 24 hours, centred on the town of Bakhmut. Ukraine is expected to ask for more air-defence weapons in a meeting with allies this week, according to the *Financial Times*.

America’s **Supreme Court** extended until Friday its freeze on a lower-court ruling that would have restricted access to mifepristone, an **abortion** pill. The drug will remain available while the justices consider whether to keep mifepristone on the market. A federal judge in Texas had [suspended approval](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/08/a-federal-judge-in-texas-rules-against-a-popular-abortion-medication) of the drug on April 7th, prompting a series of appeals.

Officials in **Florida** approved extending a ban on classroom instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity up to 12th grade, when pupils are 17 and 18. Dubbed [“Don’t Say Gay”](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/30/why-florida-is-banning-lessons-on-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity) by critics, the law already applied to younger children. It is the most recent volley in the culture wars from Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor, who last week [signed a six-week abortion ban](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/15/ron-desantiss-six-week-abortion-ban-brings-risks-to-women).

**India** will overtake China as the world’s **most populous country** this year, according to new data from the UN. By then [India’s population](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/01/05/india-will-soon-overtake-china-as-the-worlds-most-populous-country) is estimated to hit 1.429bn, exceeding the 1.426bn in China. India is expected to grow to 1.668bn by 2050; China’s population is set to shrink to around 1.317bn by the same date.

### Will the party continue for American Express?

Times may be tough for the average [inflation-squeezed consumer](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/02/19/the-worlds-13trn-interest-bill), but for the well-heeled customers of American Express, a credit-card company, the post-pandemic spending splurge is yet to end. In the final quarter of last year the company reported 17% revenue growth year-on-year. For the first quarter of this year analysts anticipate an even frothier 19% when the company’s results are revealed on Thursday.

Growth expectations for Amex are well above those for rivals Mastercard and Visa. The mass-market consumers they cater to have less wiggle room to indulge themselves as the cost of living rises.

Still, investors are keeping their cards in their wallets. Amex’s share price is down by roughly 10% from a year ago. Credit card delinquency rates in America have been steadily rising, and investors have noticed the large provisions Amex has been making for loan losses, which topped $1bn last quarter. Ultimately, its affluent customers rely on a healthy economy, too.

### Georgia v Russia at the ECHR

Russia’s attack [on Georgia](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2008/08/14/a-scripted-war) in 2008 followed a pattern later repeated in Ukraine: bogus claims to defend a threatened minority, followed by invasion, occupation and violence. On Thursday the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will give its verdict on a case flowing from the war in Georgia.

Three Georgian men, Davit Basharuli, Giga Otkhozoria and Archil Tatunashvili, were allegedly tortured and killed by authorities in the Russian-occupied regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The incidents occurred separately in 2014, 2016 and 2018 but Georgia’s government grouped them together, charging Russia with violating the European Convention on Human Rights.

The case is about more than individual crimes. It charges that Russia systematically harasses, tortures and murders Georgians living in or near the regions it controls. Proving such patterns of repressive behaviour will be crucial to war-crimes prosecutions related to Ukraine as well. Last year Russia withdrew from the ECHR, though it is still liable for actions while it was a member.

### European trade finding a new normal

EU trade used to be stable and predictable. In recent years it has been anything but. Commerce with Britain has been erratic since Brexit. The covid-19 pandemic led to a decline in sales of traded goods, as well as tourism, but caused an increase in imports from China. The energy shock last year, after Russia invaded Ukraine, caused imported-energy costs to surge, leading to a trade deficit. Sanctions on Russia then led exports to that country to plunge.

EU data released on Thursday, however, may show whether things are becoming more predictable. Imports from China seem to have peaked in mid-2022 and have since declined, while exports to the country are flat. The EU’s overall trade balance switched back into surplus as energy became cheaper, but the surplus may be permanently smaller than before the invasion. And while imports from Russia are still in decline, exports to Ukraine and Kazakhstan have surged. Those looking for a stable pattern may have to wait.

### Bolivia’s looming economic crisis

Problems are piling up for Bolivia’s president, Luis Arce. The country’s cash[ reserves](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/18/bolivia-is-on-the-brink-of-an-economic-crisis) are insufficient to cover even three months’ worth of imports. Bolivians queued up to purchase dollars as the central bank has run out of money. That caused the price of sovereign bonds to plummet. Production of natural gas, which Bolivia’s economy depends upon, has fallen, too. The IMF predicts that GDP will grow by just 1.8% in 2023, the lowest rate in three years.

Political unrest, as so often in Bolivia, is brewing, too. Mr Arce has led the country since 2020, a year after protests prompted [Evo Morales](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/11/11/bolivia-in-chaos-as-evo-morales-departs), the socialist president, to flee. Now unions are demonstrating against a number of bills proposed by Mr Arce’s left-wing government. One, which would expand the legal definition of terrorism, is widely seen as a threat to freedom of assembly. A similar bill, proposed in 2021, prompted nearly a week of street protests. Mr Arce was forced to withdraw that measure. Back then, the economy was booming. This time, with economic conditions so dire, anger may be even more intense.

### An AI and a nun face off

Technology and religion—one offering salvation in this world, the other in the next—can seem to be at odds. That tension is the subject of “Mrs Davis”, a curious new television series that begins streaming on Peacock in America on Thursday.

Billions of users connect to Mrs Davis, the world’s most powerful artificial intelligence, through an earpiece, turning to the maternal machine for “gentle guidance, structure and care”. The AI sets its users on “quests” for self-improvement, and is credited by many with saving humanity. Sister Simone, a quiet young nun from Reno, Nevada, with a mysterious past, disagrees. Unconvinced that Mrs Davis is well meaning, she refuses to engage with it. The AI comes looking for her—and an existential battle begins.

The show is timely. As AI has improved people’s lives in more obvious ways, anxieties about its influence have grown. In Sister Simone, AI sceptics may find a heroine.
