Antony Blinken, **America’s** secretary of state, said conflict in the **Middle East** “could easily metastasise” as he began a five-day trip to the region. He pledged to tell Israeli officials to increase efforts to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza. King Abdullah of Jordan urged Mr Blinken to advocate for an immediate ceasefire. [Binyamin Netanyahu](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/03/binyamin-netanyahu-is-botching-the-war-time-to-sack-him), Israel’s prime minister, vowed to keep fighting until Hamas is eliminated. This week Israel’s cabinet is expected to approve a [wartime](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/30/israel-prepares-for-a-long-war-in-gaza) budget for the year ahead.

**China** said it had detained a foreign consultant spying for **Britain’s** intelligence service, MI6. It said the alleged spy is from a “third country”. China has subjected the consultancy sector to a counter-espionage crackdown over the past year and introduced a new anti-spying law that increased the number of activities that could be deemed spying.

A day before **America’s House and Senate** return from their break, congressional leaders said they had reached a $1.7trn deal to finance the federal government in 2024. Two deadlines loom: around one-fifth of funding will run out on January 19th, with the rest expiring on February 2nd. Before then recalcitrant House Republicans will need to be won over—no small feat.

**Boeing** scheduled an all-hands safety meeting to discuss the company’s response to a section of one of its 737 Max 9 planes falling off shortly after takeoff. America’s National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause. Earlier the regulator ordered the grounding of other planes of the same model used by American carriers or in American territories. Several defects have been found in [Boeing](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/12/18/boeings-misplaced-strategy-on-the-737-max) planes in recent years.

Sheikh Hasina, **Bangladesh’s** prime minister for the past 15 years, won [a fifth term](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/12/14/sheikh-hasinas-party-is-set-to-be-re-elected-in-january). The country’s electoral commission claimed 40% of around 120m eligible voters cast ballots; analysts suggested turnout was much lower. Thousands of members of the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, were arrested in the run up to the election, drawing international condemnation. The BNP boycotted the poll.

Meanwhile, nearly 7,000 **Rohingya refugees** were left homeless after a fire at a camp in south-eastern **Bangladesh**. The United Nations refugee agency said around 800 shelters were destroyed, along with mosques and health and education facilities. Almost a million Rohingyas—a [persecuted Muslim minority](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/12/07/rohingya-refugees-return-to-the-sea) from neighbouring Myanmar—live in the camps of Cox’s Bazar, where crowded conditions often result in disastrous blazes.

“Oppenheimer”, Christopher Nolan’s epic about the first atomic bomb, won the most awards at the **Golden Globes**, sweeping five prizes including those for best drama, best director and best actor. “Barbie”, [its rival](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/07/14/realism-with-oppenheimer-or-escapism-with-barbie) for summer cinema-goers’ attention, won for best cinematic and box-office achievement and best song. “Succession” collected the most television awards, with four wins including best drama.

### China’s spying spooks America

On Monday a judge in California sentenced a navy sailor to 27 months in federal prison. Wenheng “Thomas” Zhao, a petty officer at a base in Ventura County, earlier pleaded guilty to passing secrets to Chinese intelligence in exchange for bribes worth nearly $15,000. The Chinese-born American citizen admitted in October to handing over information about a military exercise in the Pacific and blueprints for a radar system in Japan, among other things.

The case, one of two involving naval servicemen, is further evidence of the scale and breadth of [Chinese espionage](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/06/09/america-and-china-try-to-move-past-a-new-bump-in-relations) in America, with China seeking not only military secrets but wholesale information about Western technology. In October the FBI hosted the counter-intelligence chiefs of the Five Eyes—America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand—in Silicon Valley to highlight the theft of intellectual property, describing China as the “defining threat of this generation”.

### Germany’s gloomy manufacturing and trade

It is a bad time to be a German manufacturer. International demand is sluggish. Germany’s biggest export—cars—is under threat from cheaper Chinese EVs and American protectionism. Higher interest rates are hitting investment spending, which lowers demand for machinery (Germany’s second-biggest export). And domestic energy prices are too high to competitively produce certain chemicals: the third-largest export.

The latest data on German trade and manufacturing for November, published on Monday, are set to be suitably cheerless. They will probably show that imports have kept falling faster than exports, though both are declining. That, ironically, improves the trade balance—but it is a sign of weakness in the [German economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/17/the-german-economy-from-european-leader-to-laggard). Manufacturing orders are below their level of 2015, after a post-pandemic boom. One bright spot is that surveys indicate that the decline in new orders for industrial goods is slowing. But it will be some time before Germany’s industry and trade are a source of strength again.

### An unhappy new year for American lawmakers

Last year America’s Congress only passed 27 bills that became law—making [2023](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/28/from-duck-stamps-to-doomsday-the-past-year-in-american-politics) its least productive year this decade. When the Senate returns on Monday it will have lots to do, and limited capacity for doing it.

A bipartisan group of senators has spent months negotiating to provide aid for Ukraine and other American allies in exchange for tightening border security. They hope to share an outline of a deal this week. As well as persuading other senators, they will also have to win over the House, which is controlled by a paper-thin Republican majority. It has recently sounded more hawkish on the issue. Mike Johnson, the speaker, could face rebellion if he accepts terms unpopular with his party’s right wing.

At least congressional leaders reached a tentative deal on Sunday to fund the federal government in 2024, to the tune of $1.66trn. They are racing against the clock: a first tranche of funding for government operations expires on January 19th, and the rest runs out on February 2nd. But the agreement is sure to be a tough sell in the House. Previously asked about the chances of avoiding a partial government shutdown, the White House budget director had declared herself “not optimistic”.

### Britain’s long slog to its next election

Britain’s Parliament also returns from its Christmas recess on Monday. It has a heap of legislation to work through, including proposed laws on regulating digital markets, residential properties and a highly controversial scheme to [deport asylum-seekers](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/12/14/the-magical-thinking-behind-britains-rwanda-bill) to Rwanda.

But all attention will be elsewhere: on the long campaign for the general election, which Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, has indicated will be held in the second half of the year. That will be a gruelling slog for Conservative politicians, who are trailing by up to 20 points in opinion polls. And other tests of the government’s popularity will come sooner. By-elections are slated for Wellingborough and Blackpool South, triggered by the misconduct of two Tory MPs. A third awaits in Kingswood: Chris Skidmore, a leading figure in the Conservative environmental caucus, resigned from Parliament on January 5th in protest over legislation which would permit new oil and gas exploration. The Labour Party is well-placed to take all three.

### College football’s winning formula

In America, college football is big business. The country’s universities train the athletes that are drafted into the National Football League, the world’s [most lucrative](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/06/15/which-sport-is-the-best-business) sports competition. On Monday night the final of the national College Football Playoff will determine which institution has the best team in the country. The Washington Huskies play the Michigan Wolverines at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, in front of a sold-out crowd of more than 70,000.

According to analysis by Sportico, an analytics company, Washington reported revenue in excess of $130m in 2021-22, while Michigan raked in $91m. Such earnings are comparable with those of established clubs in the English Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. And the future for college football finances looks bright: the current four-team playoff tournament is expanding to 12 from next season, which is all but certain to ensure a big jump in broadcasting revenue.
