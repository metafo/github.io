## The world in brief

### October 6, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

At least 51 people were killed in a **Russian attack** on a shop and café in the village of Hroza, in north-eastern Ukraine, according to officials. A six-year-old boy was reportedly among the victims. Earlier, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president spoke to the **European Political Community**, a forum of 47 countries, convening for its third meeting since it was [proposed](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/06/meet-the-brand-new-european-political-community) by Emmanuel Macron in 2022. Mr Zelensky reiterated his faith in American support, which has been in question after a stopgap bill enacted this week paused the country’s aid to Ukraine.

The **World Trade Organisation** lowered its trade growth forecast for 2023 citing growing [geopolitical tensions](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/10/02/attempts-to-make-supply-chains-resilient-are-likely-to-fail), manufacturing slowdowns, persistent inflation in America and Europe, and turmoil in China’s property markets. All, it predicts, will hamper global trade. The WTO revised its estimate for export growth this year to 0.8%, down from an estimate of 1.7% in April.

**Oil prices** continued to fall, having plummeted by more than 5% on Wednesday in their steepest one-day drop in over a year. On Thursday, the price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell below $85 for the first time since August. Until this week, prices had been steadily increasing since the summer, particularly after Saudi Arabia and Russia [extended output cuts](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/03/oil-prices-fall-defying-suggestions-of-a-100-barrel) in September.

A federal court ordered **Alabama** to adopt a new electoral map that preserves one majority-black voting district and significantly increases the black population of another. The ruling could bag Democrats another lawmaker in America’s House of Representatives. The order came after the same court (and eventually the Supreme Court) [struck down](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/08/the-supreme-court-says-alabamas-electoral-map-is-discriminatory) the state’s previous map for illegally diluting the voting power of black Alabamans.

More than 100 people, including civilians, were killed in a drone attack targeting a graduation ceremony for cadets at a military academy in **Syria**. The Syrian defence minister had left the ceremony shortly before the drones struck. No group immediately claimed responsibility. Separately at least ten people were reportedly killed by Turkish drone strikes in the country’s north-east, which is [controlled](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/01/19/who-are-the-syrian-democratic-forces) by Kurds.

**China** announced that in the coming years it will double the size of its [space station](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/18/china-is-unusually-secretive-about-its-space-programme), which has been running since 2022. Chinese officials also said that the Tiangong station will be operational for more than 15 years, longer than previously expected. China is banned from the International Space Station, Tiangong’s sole low-orbit counterpart, which is expected to be retired in 2030.

The **Nobel prize** in **literature** was awarded to Jon Fosse, a Norwegian writer whose work includes plays, poetry and prose in [Nynorsk](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/09/05/languages-are-a-battleground-for-nationalists), or “new Norwegian”. Mr Fosse, born in 1959, is known for his minimalist style; the chairman of the Nobel committee praised his ability to express “the most powerful human emotions…in the simplest everyday terms”.

### Land of the rising salary

During its long battle with deflation, Japan’s economy suffered from a peculiar problem: an excess of restraint. Take, for example, the pay deals offered to workers. Even when growth was strong and unemployment low, firms would not commit themselves to meaningful increases in the base pay of their core workforce. They preferred instead to offer one-time bonuses or higher pay for non-permanent staff. Some economists began advocating an incomes policy, not to keep wages in check, but to force them up.

Japan hopes to have now entered a new era of robust demand, modest inflation and steadily rising wages. In July, firms increased the “scheduled” earnings of full-time employees by 2.4%, compared with the salaries they offered a year earlier. That was the first increase above 2% since 1997, according to Citigroup, a bank. It was followed by a respectable 1.8% rise in August, according to figures released on Friday. The country may finally be restraining its restraint.

### America’s Goldilocks labour market

The American economy is on a narrow path. To avoid a recession, the [labour market](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/05/to-understand-americas-job-market-look-beyond-unemployed-workers) must remain strong so that it can continue to generate new jobs. But to [tame inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/05/economists-draw-swords-over-how-to-fix-inflation), it cannot be [too strong](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/09/does-america-need-more-unemployment), because that might cause rapid wage growth. So far it has maintained this balance, but things may be getting trickier. Over the past few months the unemployment rate has ticked up, yet wages are still rising at a pace well above the Fed’s inflation target of 2%.

Data released on Friday may provide a modicum of good news. Forecasters think the unemployment rate may have actually edged down to 3.7% in September, from 3.8% in August. They also predict that wage growth, though a little stronger than in August, was slower than the average of the previous two years. A soft landing for the economy is still improbable—but with more figures like these, not impossible.

### The EU wants to get bigger

The leaders of the EU’s 27 member states will meet in the Spanish city of Granada on Friday, to discuss how they might [increase their ranks](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/28/the-eu-is-finally-rebooting-the-enlargement-machine) by nine. [Enlargement](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/05/fifty-years-ago-the-eu-cracked-the-secret-of-its-current-success) has been dormant for over a decade—no country has joined the bloc since Croatia in 2013. But the war in Ukraine has rekindled interest in granting it access, as well as six other countries in the Western Balkans (including Serbia and Albania), Georgia and Moldova.

That might require a reworking of the EU’s rules, such as how farmers are supported, which could take years. The leaders will also discuss the sharp increase in migrants reaching the continent’s southern shores. A plan to spread the burden of processing claims for asylum more widely across the EU—and not just leave it to the countries where the boats arrive—was agreed on earlier this year, but is not working well. Expect only limited progress; the problem is too large for a single summit.

### NYC may shut its golden door

On Friday Eric Adams, the Democratic mayor of New York City, arrives in Ecuador. The purpose of his anti-charm offensive through Latin America is to discourage migrants there from heading northwards. Over 120,000 migrants have [come to New York](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/13/20000-asylum-seekers-are-putting-new-york-values-to-the-test), overwhelming the city’s [shelter system](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/24/new-yorks-shelter-system-is-being-overwhelmed-by-migrants). Mr Adams, once amenable to migrants, now says that New York is “at capacity” and that Joe Biden is not doing enough to solve the problem.

His message in Latin America is that housing and legal work opportunities in New York are limited. Back home, his office is distributing flyers in shelters reiterating the message. Such tactics are controversial, but other strained cities like Chicago may consider similar measures. The federal government has made it easier for Venezuelan migrants to obtain work permits and released millions of dollars of extra support for communities that host them. So far, this has not persuaded Mr Adams to echo the Statue of Liberty’s welcome to the “huddled masses”.

### Modern dating on screen

“Cat Person”, an internet-breaking tale of 21st-century dating, returns as a film on Friday in America. It will air in Britain three weeks later. The [original short story](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/12/14/what-is-it-about-cat-person) by Kristen Roupenian caused a sensation when it ran in the *New Yorker* in 2017, igniting passionate debates about consent, body-shaming and the male bias of literary culture. Directed by Susanna Fogel, the film stars Nicholas Braun (cousin Greg in “[Succession](https://www.economist.com/culture/2021/10/29/the-success-of-succession-proves-the-virtue-of-hateful-characters)”) and Emilia Jones as Robert and Margot, a couple whose text-message flirtation sours when they meet in the flesh.

Like the story it is based on, the film captures the ebb and flow of power throughout a romance and the pressures that can lead women into unwanted situations. It also bulks out the plot (and running time) with an extra final act that forgoes the nuance of the story for a thrillerish payoff. In passing, it also clears up the mystery of whether Robert actually has cats.
