## The world in brief

### March 21, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



The **Federal Reserve** left its benchmark interest rate unchanged, as expected, at a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, said he was pleased with progress in bringing inflation down but did not indicate when rate cuts might begin. (Investors largely reckon June.) America’s central bankers still expect to lower rates three times this year as growth slows, and markets soared on the news: the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices all hit record highs.

**Reddit** reportedly priced its shares at $34, valuing the social-media firm at about $6.4bn, ahead of a listing on Thursday in New York. It will raise $748m through the share sale, a rare bright spot amid a [lacklustre few years for public offerings](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/22/the-age-of-the-unicorn-is-over). In 2021, when venture-capital money was free-flowing, Reddit was privately valued at $10bn.

**America** will give $8.5bn in funding to **Intel**, with a further $11bn in loans, to grow the company’s capacity to make advanced chips. The firm also hopes to receive $25bn in tax breaks as competes with [international rivals](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/05/29/nvidia-is-not-the-only-firm-cashing-in-on-the-ai-gold-rush) such as TSMC, a Taiwanese chipmaker. America’s CHIPS act, passed in 2022, aims to boost the country’s semiconductor industry and increase domestic chip manufacturing.

**Leo Varadkar** unexpectedly resigned as **Ireland’s** taoiseach. He said that he had made the decision for both “personal and political reasons”. Mr Varadkar [first took the post in 2017](https://www.economist.com/europe/2017/06/10/irelands-first-gay-leader-will-struggle-more-with-brexit-than-bigotry), becoming Ireland’s youngest prime minister. He then served as deputy prime minister between 2020 and 2022 before [returning to the top job](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/15/irelands-new-prime-minister-is-mocked-before-he-starts). Ireland will hold a general election by the spring of 2025.

**Canada** will not approve new weapons-export permits to **Israel**, given the death toll in Gaza. Canadian law prohibits selling arms to countries that violate human rights or harm women and children. The government confirmed the export freeze on Wednesday after Canada’s parliament earlier passed a non-binding motion urging the move. Israel’s foreign minister said that history would judge Canada’s actions “harshly”.

**Vietnam’s** president, Vo Van Thuong, resigned after a little more than a year in office. The Communist Party said that he had committed “violations” that “left a bad mark” on its reputation. Earlier this month a former provincial leader connected to Mr Thuong was arrested on corruption charges. Mr Thuong’s predecessor in the largely ceremonial position resigned owing to a graft scandal in 2023.

**France’s** competition watchdog fined Google €250m ($272m) for breaching a licensing deal with French media outlets. The regulator said that the American tech giant had not negotiated in “good faith” with publishers over [how much to pay](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/10/17/should-big-tech-save-newspapers) for displaying their content on its platforms. French authorities issued a €500m fine to Google for similar reasons in 2021.

### The EU’s fragmented foreign policy

On Thursday the leaders of the EU’s 27 countries will attend the first of four summits to be held in the next 100 days. The confab will focus on defence and foreign policy, and especially on the [conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/11/13/from-gaza-to-ukraine-wars-and-crises-are-piling-up).

Politicians will discuss how Europe can [spend more](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/25/the-eus-help-to-ukraine-is-a-far-cry-from-its-rhetoric)—and better—on defence to deter Russia. They will debate about (but probably reach no firm agreement on) how to use windfall profits on frozen Russian assets. More contentious still will be discussion of the recent suggestion by Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, that some countries may send troops to Ukraine. That would cross a red line for many, including the EU’s largest member, Germany.

On the [situation in Gaza](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/04/on-gaza-europe-is-struggling-to-make-its-diplomacy-matter) the rifts within the EU are wider yet. The discussion between backers of Israel and governments more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause will be heated.

### Nike races to stay ahead

Nike, the world’s largest [maker of sportswear](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/03/23/can-adidas-ever-catch-up-with-nike), announces its quarterly results on Thursday, covering the three months ending in February 2024. In the last fiscal year, which ended in May 2023, Nike’s annual sales were up by a tenth. But the company expects only a 1% growth in sales this year. The slowdown is partly caused by softening consumer demand, especially in China and Europe. Nike is also losing ground to upstart footwear brands like Hoka and On Running.

To “reignite” its growth, the company announced in February that it would cut more than 1,500 jobs, or 2% of its workforce. This was part of a plan to trim costs by $2bn over the next three years. The company is also investing in smaller, techier stores designed to showcase its products and encourage people to shop online. By 2025 Nike aims to sell 60% of its wares directly to consumers, either online or through its own stores, cutting out traditional retailers. The brand is also expecting a boost from the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, where it will be the official sponsor of the American gymnastics team.

### What’s the right rate for Britain?

The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee will meet on Thursday to set interest rates. At its last meeting in January, a majority of the committee’s members opted to keep the policy rate flat at 5.25%. Unusually, though, there was dissent in both directions: two members voted to raise rates and one to lower them.

[Britain’s economy](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/the-outlook-for-the-british-economy-is-better-than-expected) looks feeble. The country entered a technical recession in the second half of 2023, though the economy expanded a bit in January. The annual inflation rate continued to fall from 4% in January to 3.4% in February. Weak growth and lower inflation might nudge the committee towards [lowering rates](https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/02/08/britains-economy-will-need-rate-cuts-sooner-rather-than-later). But it will probably delay that decision, in part because of speculation that another pre-election fiscal event could take place over the summer or in early autumn. Further tax giveaways could reignite inflation. In the absence of a rate change, analysts will focus on shifts in the committee’s language and voting patterns.

### Reddit’s buzzy IPO

On Thursday shares in [Reddit](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/06/26/why-reddit-users-are-protesting-against-the-sites-leadership) will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The social-media platform is seeking a valuation of around $6bn. The listing is reportedly four to five times oversubscribed. But some are sceptical that the stock will be a hit.

Founded in 2005, Reddit is a forum-based website where members talk on “subreddits” about shared interests, ranging from do-it-yourself plumbing to cat photos. The site claims to have 267m average weekly active users. Even so, its annual revenues of $800m, almost all from advertising, are lower than those of rivals such as X (formerly Twitter). It recorded a loss of $91m in 2023.

It has other worries, too. America’s Federal Trade Commission is probing the company’s licensing of user data to firms that are developing artificial-intelligence models. (Reddit says it has done nothing wrong.) Even if investors do not flock to Reddit’s stock, they may still cheer its listing as a sign that America’s IPO market is slowly coming back to life.

### Has the UN’s climate treaty failed?

Thursday marks 30 years since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change first came into force. The treaty committed signatories to stabilising [greenhouse-gas concentrations](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2023-11-25) in order to “prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”. But despite being ratified by 197 countries and the EU, pessimists would say the convention has failed to achieve its aim.

Since 1994, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has risen from around 360 parts per million to around 425. By the end of the century average global temperatures are expected to be roughly 2.7°C higher than those before the industrial revolution, well above the generally accepted upper limit of 2°C.

Optimists, however, might point out that things once looked much worse: when the UNFCCC was forged, business-as-usual projections showed temperatures rising by 3.5°C or more. The shift is due, in large part, to international climate commitments, including the Paris agreement in 2015, hammered out under the UNFCCC.
