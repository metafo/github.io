## The world in brief

### November 7, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

The Hamas-run health ministry in **Gaza** said that more than 10,000 people have been [killed](https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/10/17/israel-gaza-map-hamas-war) in the enclave since the war began. Meanwhile the Rafah border crossing reopened on Monday, allowing foreigners and some wounded Palestinians to leave Gaza for Egypt. The route had been shut for two days. Earlier Israeli troops claimed to have encircled **Gaza city** and split the coastal enclave in two. They plan to enter the city within the next two days, according to Israeli media.

**Donald Trump** took the witness stand in the civil fraud trial against him in New York. His often off-topic testimony prompted the presiding judge to remind the former president, “This is not a political rally.” In September the judge found Mr Trump [liable for fraud](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/27/donald-trump-is-found-liable-for-fraud-in-his-real-estate-dealings) in his real-estate dealings (he has appealed against the ruling). The trial will determine, among other things, the former president’s punishment.

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the **European Commission**, said that [the EU](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/the-eus-response-to-the-crisis-in-israel-exposes-its-limits) will provide Gaza with a further €25m ($27m) in humanitarian aid this year. The funds will be given to organisations providing food, water and sanitation to Palestinians in Gaza. Eighteen **UN** bodies issued a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire.

More than 113,000 people have been displaced and 14 killed by flooding in **Somalia**, according to the UN. Around 700,000 have been “temporarily affected” by heavy rainfall driven by [El Niño](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/08/31/what-is-el-nino), a warming climate pattern. Somalia’s government declared a state of emergency in three states. The country is recovering from a years-long drought, which may have killed tens of thousands of people.

**Italy** will build two centres in **Albania** to house **migrants** who are rescued at sea by Italian boats. Irregular migration has [increased](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/14/italy-needs-more-migrants-but-has-trouble-admitting-it) under the right-wing government of Giorgia Meloni; in 2023 145,000 people arrived from north Africa. The centres, due to be completed by next spring, will host up to 3,000 people each month while Italy reviews their [asylum requests](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/12/the-eus-endless-search-for-a-migration-fix).

Shares in **WeWork**, an office-sharing company, were halted for trading, ahead of an expected bankruptcy filing. In August [the firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/03/19/why-the-wework-fiasco-makes-for-compelling-tv) warned that it had “substantial doubt” about its “ability to continue”. The stock price has tumbled by 90% since then. In 2019 the firm reached a private valuation of $47bn, only to fall apart after an abortive IPO.

Scientists discovered the oldest known **black hole**, formed 470m years after the Big Bang. The black hole exists in a galaxy 13.2bn light-years away—seen from when the universe was only 3% of its current age. It is much larger than younger [black holes](https://www.economist.com/films/2022/07/12/why-black-holes-matter), and could weigh up to 100m suns. The discovery will help scientists better understand the early iterations of supermassive black holes.

### The G7 debates Gaza

For America, the G7 group of industrialised countries is now the “steering committee of the major democracies”, where far-flung allies co-ordinate responses to [global threats](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/05/the-gaza-war-has-deepened-joe-bidens-iran-nightmare). That includes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the deepening rivalry with China. But at a two-day meeting in Tokyo, starting on Tuesday, the group’s foreign ministers will grapple with a new crisis: the war between Israel and Hamas.

G7 members will have many questions for Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, after his tour of the Middle East: can [suffering in Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/30/why-urban-warfare-in-gaza-will-be-bloodier-than-in-iraq) be eased; how and when does [the war end](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/why-israel-must-fight-on); who will [run Gaza](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/23/can-the-palestinian-authority-control-gaza-if-hamas-is-ousted); will there ever be a [Palestinian state](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/30/a-vision-for-the-palestinians-after-the-war)?

Expect few good answers. Mr Blinken has failed even to secure “humanitarian pauses” to get more aid into Gaza and, perhaps, hostages out. Arabs demand an immediate ceasefire, while [Israel insists on eliminating Hamas](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/06/israeli-soldiers-fight-to-reach-hamass-headquarters). And there is little sign that Israel has a plan for the aftermath, or that America would impose one.

### First steps for Switzerland’s megabank

Bankers, regulators and investors are keeping a close eye on the new Swiss [financial super-group](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/26/can-ubs-make-the-most-of-finances-deal-of-the-century). On Tuesday UBS reports third-quarter earnings, five months after completing its [dramatic acquisition](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/03/19/a-momentous-but-unhappy-union-ubs-saves-credit-suisse) of Credit Suisse. The results mark a return to normal financial reporting for UBS after accounting adjustments caused by the deal heavily distorted its second-quarter results.

The transaction was the first tie-up between two “global systemically important banks”, a designation introduced after the financial crisis of 2007-09. It created a giant with more than $5trn of invested assets and a balance-sheet twice the size of the Swiss economy. UBS now needs to integrate Credit Suisse’s domestic operations and shed $55bn of risk-weighted assets that do not fit its core strategies. The bank’s bosses are also hoping to hold on to clients in the bank’s huge [wealth-management division](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/05/the-100trn-battle-for-the-worlds-wealthiest-people) and plan to cut more than $10bn in costs by the end of 2026.

### Britain’s tidy-up Parliament

The full pageantry of the British state will be on display on Tuesday at the state opening of Parliament, which kicks off the parliamentary year. It will be the first such occasion for King Charles since he [succeeded his mother](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown) last year—and for Rishi Sunak since he succeeded Liz Truss as prime minister.

The king will announce the government’s legislative agenda in probably the last speech before the general election, [due by January 2025](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/03/when-should-rishi-sunak-call-the-next-british-election). That will involve tying up complex bills carried over from the last session of Parliament—including major packages on competition in digital markets and data protection.

But expect also a grab-bag of eye-catching measures that the Tories hope will draw clear dividing lines between themselves and Labour ahead of the election. These include measures to encourage oil-and-gas exploration in the North Sea, to force convicted prisoners to appear in court for sentencing and to restrict the use of tents by homeless people.

### Americans choose their local leaders

A year before the presidential election, Americans will vote in state and local races on Tuesday. Residents of Kentucky and Mississippi will choose new governors; those in New Jersey and Virginia will elect local lawmakers; and Ohioans will decide whether to [codify abortion rights](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/19/anti-abortion-campaigners-try-to-break-their-losing-streak) in their state’s constitution.

Much attention will be paid to Virginia, which is considered a bellwether for the following year’s races. Though not on the ballot, Glenn Youngkin, the governor, is stumping for Republicans from Virginia Beach to the suburbs of Washington, DC. His policy agenda has been stunted by a Democratic majority in the senate. But if Republicans flip just two seats there, and hold the lower chamber, they plan to slash taxes and enact a 15-week abortion ban. Mr Youngkin, the only governor in the country limited to one term at a time, is eager to secure his legacy. Many suspect he has his eye set on a higher office in Washington.

### Hong Kong’s defeated democratic dream

There is a [rule of thumb](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/17/what-is-the-35-rule-beloved-of-climate-protesters) that no government can stymie a protest movement that mobilises more than 3.5% of the population. For Hong Kongers in 2019, attracting such numbers was *sap sap seoi*—a piece of cake. On June 9th, for example, one pro-democracy demonstration brought 1m people—13% of the territory—onto the streets.

Yet, four years later, the authorities have so completely [snuffed out](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/02/hong-kongs-year-of-protest-now-feels-like-a-mirage) open dissent that those days feel like a mirage. “[Among the Braves](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/02/hong-kongs-year-of-protest-now-feels-like-a-mirage)”, a new book by Shibani Mahtani and Timothy McLaughlin, offers some explanation as to why.

Partly it was the pandemic, which halted street gatherings and gave China’s Communist Party space to foist a draconian national-security law on Hong Kong. But it was also that the movement forgot the tactics that had served it well, such as being leaderless and fluid. Its descent into chaos made it easy prey for the police. Now, the staunchest activists are either behind bars or have fled abroad.
