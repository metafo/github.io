## The world in brief

### February 3, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

“If you harm an American, we will respond,” Joe Biden said after America launched several air strikes at military sites in Iraq and Syria. According to US Central Command, they were targeting Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps “and affiliated militia groups”. Iranian state news reported that at least ten people have died in Syria. The strikes come less than a week after drones launched by militants [killed three American soldiers](https://web.archive.org/web/20240203073556/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/28/violence-spirals-as-irans-proxies-kill-american-soldiers) in Jordan.

Hafize Gaye Erkan, the governor of Turkey’s central bank, resigned following what she called a “reputation assassination”. Local media recently alleged that her father interfered with the bank’s affairs despite not working there (she denies the allegations). Since being appointed in June, she had dramatically raised interest rates to fight inflation. The finance minister said that policy would continue.

More than 800 officials in America and multiple countries in Europe signed the first joint letter criticising their governments for their positions on the [war in Gaza](https://web.archive.org/web/20240203073556/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/01/how-to-end-the-middle-easts-agony). They warned that their support for Israel could amount to “grave violations of international humanitarian law” and risked making them complicit in one of “the worst human catastrophes of this century”. The signatories did not disclose their identities.

Pakistan’s military said it killed 24 militants in three days in Balochistan province, near the border with Afghanistan, after they launched attacks in the towns of Mach and Kolpur. The Balochistan Liberation Army, a separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attacks. Four law enforcement personnel and two civilians were also killed. [Pakistan](https://web.archive.org/web/20240203073556/https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/01/30/imran-khan-is-convicted-pakistans-generals-are-content) will hold a general election next week.

Meta’s market value increased by $197bn to $1.2trn, the biggest ever one-day gain on Wall Street. Shares in the [social-media](https://web.archive.org/web/20240203073556/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/01/the-end-of-the-social-network) firm surged by 20% on Friday after it revealed bumper fourth-quarter results and announced its first-ever dividend. Similarly, a positive earnings report from Amazon boosted the e-commerce giant’s shares by 8%. America’s S&P 500 share index closed at a record high.

Tesla will recall more than 2m vehicles in America after regulators said that the small font size of some warning lights “can make critical safety information” hard to read. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it identified the problem on January 8th during a routine audit. The recall is Tesla’s third safety update in three months.

A white-naped crane called Walnut died aged 42 at Smithsonian’s National Zoo. Walnut, who was raised by humans and uninterested in other cranes, was famous for having a human mate: her keeper persuaded her to undergo artificial insemination by mimicking the crane mating dance, producing eight chicks. If age is an indicator, Walnut was happy: white-naped cranes usually live about 15 years in captivity.

### Facebook turns 20

The world’s largest social network, [which turns 20](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/02/01/as-facebook-turns-20-politics-is-out-impersonal-video-feeds-are-in) on Sunday, marked the occasion this week with two familiar rituals. On Wednesday Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, went to Washington, DC for a mauling by senators over the harm the platform has done to children. Then, on Thursday, Meta, Facebook’s parent company, turned in another set of record financial earnings, sending its market capitalisation soaring to $1.2trn.

It may seem like business as usual. But the social-media experience is changing. Apps like TikTok, since copied by Facebook and nearly everyone else, serve users a diet of content made by strangers rather than by people they know or follow. Meanwhile, users are posting their own updates and comments less often, instead taking their conversations to closed platforms like WhatsApp. The future of social media is looking rather like the past: one set of apps that resemble television, and another that look more like email or the phone.

### Indonesia’s final presidential debate

People like to see a good fight. As [Indonesia’s election](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-indonesia-election-tracker) approaches on February 14th, the four televised presidential debates in recent weeks were each watched by around 100m people; candidates’ performances were dissected over dinner tables and across [social media](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/02/01/tiktok-is-a-key-battleground-in-indonesias-election). The final show on Sunday night is expected to draw just as many viewers in the world’s third-largest democracy. Candidates will debate education, employment, health care and social welfare.

The presidential race already has a clear front-runner. Prabowo Subianto, a former general who revels in a strongman image, has twice failed to become the country’s leader. But as Joko Widodi, who beat him both times, steps down as president, Mr Prabowo has his opening. The question is whether he can win the presidency by securing a majority in the first round, or whether the election will go to a run-off in June. Wavering voters may turn to their televisions this weekend to make their choice.

### Taylor Swift’s blank space at the Grammys

She is now so inescapable that the [MAGA](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/13/how-maga-republicans-plan-to-make-donald-trumps-second-term-count) movement concocts conspiracy theories around her. (They suggest she is an agent of the Pentagon.) Her current[ Eras tour](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/12/13/the-excitement-of-70000-swifties-can-shake-the-earth) is the first by any musician to gross $1bn. Yet the more of the world Taylor Swift conquers, the less America’s music industry wants to reward her with its biggest prizes.

When she was still a genre star, her [country](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/09/01/thanks-to-morgan-wallen-country-musics-popularity-has-surged) albums would easily win Grammy awards. But since “1989”, an album released in 2014, made her a pop colossus, the academy has been a little chary. Though she has twice won album of the year, she has never scooped record or song of the year. (Along with best new artist, which also eluded the younger Ms Swift, these make up the “big four” awards.)

On Sunday in Los Angeles, that may change. Ms Swift’s “Anti-Hero” is up for both the record and song prizes. Even the Grammys—a ceremony that frequently baffles—can surely not avoid recognising her.

### Can padel become a mainstream professional sport?

How to entice fans to watch a new competition in a niche sport? The organisers of the Hexagon Cup reckon that recruiting famous players from other sports and offering lots of cash should do it. They are trying to sell padel, a racket sport that combines elements of tennis and squash, which has been [growing in popularity](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/26/pickleball-and-padel-are-challenging-tenniss-supremacy), particularly in Argentina, Portugal and Spain. In Madrid this week padel teams, including teams owned by tennis stars Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal and footballer Robert Lewandowski, have been competing for a €1m ($1.1m) prize pot. The winner is to be crowned on Sunday.

Professional padel competitions are vying with each other for attention, too. Padel has already received Middle Eastern investment: in 2023 Qatar Sports Investments bought the World Padel Tour and will merge it with its rival, Premier Padel, to create a single set of events. These will happen for the first time in 2024. With celebrity endorsements and plentiful funding, padel’s rapid growth seems assured.

### Weekend profile: Nayib Bukele, El Salvador’s leader

On January 23rd Nayib Bukele wrote on X: “He who saves his country violates no law.” The quote—usually attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte—was referring to Mr Bukele’s harsh crackdown on gangs. But it could equally apply to his [second consecutive term](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/06/how-nayib-bukele-is-breaking-presidential-term-limits-in-el-salvador) as president, which he is sure to win when Salvadoreans vote on Sunday.

El Salvador’s constitution clearly bars a second consecutive term in office. But Mr Bukele got the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court to deem it viable if he stepped down from power in November. He did so on paper—but he still runs the country.

There has been little pushback because the 42-year-old leather-jacket-sporting president is by far the [most popular leader in Latin America](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/07/20/nayib-bukele-shows-how-to-dismantle-a-democracy-and-stay-popular). Much of that is thanks to his hardline gang policies. He has made El Salvador safer, even as he violates human rights.

But his dominance over Salvadoran politics is also due to his tactical rise to power, and the way he has taken control of all levers of it. Born to a well-off family of Palestinian descent, Mr Bukele dropped out of university to run his father’s advertising agency, honing the communications skills that would bolster his political career.

In 2011 he was elected as a local mayor, and then as mayor of the capital, San Salvador. In June 2019 he became president. Since then he has used strong-arm tactics to get his way. In February 2020, for example, he entered the assembly with soldiers to force lawmakers to approve his security budget. And once his New Ideas party won a majority in the assembly in February 2021, he gradually co-opted the state, replacing judges on the supreme court and the attorney-general who was investigating allegations of government corruption. His crackdown on crime relies on a never-ending state of emergency, with mass round-ups and hearings. El Salvador looks every day less like a democracy.

But that does not bother a president who controls the narrative. He mocks critics and deploys trolls to harass them further. He announces new policies on social media. One expert reckons that he needs just 12 hours to get the country talking about a topic, compared with the 500 hours it takes for the opposition. As he closes in on a second term Mr Bukele says he does not want to stay indefinitely. That may well change.
