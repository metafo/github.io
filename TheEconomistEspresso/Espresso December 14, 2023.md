## The world in brief

### December 14, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Israel’s foreign minister** said the [war in Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/10/israel-has-just-a-few-weeks-left-to-destroy-hamas) will continue “with or without international support”, despite the Israeli army’s suffering its worst day of casualties since October. Earlier the UN General Assembly passed a resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. More than 150 member states voted for the non-binding resolution; ten, including America, voted against.

The **Federal Reserve** left its benchmark interest rate unchanged, acknowledging that inflation “has eased over the past year but remains elevated”. The Fed last raised rates in July, to a range of 5.25 to 5.5—the highest in 22 years. Rate-setters think that there will be three cuts next year.

The 198 countries at the **COP28** summit unanimously agreed to pass a landmark final agreement that “calls on” nations to “transition” away from fossil fuels—although it falls short of suggesting they be “phased out”. An earlier, weaker draft agreement had said they should merely be “limited”, provoking much criticism. No previous [COP summit](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/16/three-climate-fights-will-dominate-cop28) has managed to negotiate collective action that could eventually end the oil age.

America’s **Supreme Court** will review a decision limiting access to mifepristone, an **abortion** pill. Last year anti-abortion organisations [sued](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/08/a-federal-judge-in-texas-rules-against-a-popular-abortion-medication) to ban the pill. A [conservative](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/30/a-maga-court-in-new-orleans-is-shaping-the-supreme-courts-agenda) lower court partially ruled in their favour, rolling back rules that allowed people to take the drug later in pregnancy and get it through the post. Those restrictions have been paused since appeals began.

**Germany’s** ruling coalition reached a deal to resolve a budget crisis. A [controversial court ruling](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/30/germanys-ruling-coalition-grapples-with-a-wrecked-budget) in November had left the government with a significant funding gap. The coalition said on Wednesday that it would retain borrowing restrictions in 2024, making savings of €17bn ($18.3bn) in its core budget and cutting back on its climate and transition fund.

The **IMF** approved around $1bn of loans for **Sri Lanka** and **Bangladesh**. The [funds](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/04/04/the-imf-faces-a-nightmarish-identity-crisis) for Sri Lanka will help stabilise the country’s economy after it defaulted on its sovereign debt last year; those for Bangladesh will be crucial for easing currency pressures. Both countries have general elections scheduled next year; the loans may help boost support for incumbent politicians.

**Albania** said it will use **ChatGPT**, a chatbot developed by OpenAI, to translate thousands of pages of legal documents into Albanian to speed up its accession into the EU. The government hopes the tool will allow it to incorporate EU rules into the country’s existing legal structures more easily. The decision follows a deal with [OpenAI’s CEO](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/21/inside-openais-weird-governance-structure), Mira Murati, who was born in Albania.

### Putin’s grand show

On Thursday Vladimir Putin is scheduled to hold a press conference and a televised phone-in for Russian citizens. Both give the president a chance to sound confident under a semblance of scrutiny. The events are supposed to be annual, but in 2022 the Kremlin cancelled them as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine faltered.

Their return shows Mr Putin’s [renewed self-assurance](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/30/how-putin-is-reshaping-russia-to-keep-his-war-machine-running). Since the chaotic, early days of the invasion, the president has stabilised the economy and quashed dissent. Last week he confirmed he would stand in [Russia’s sham election in 2024](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/vladimir-putin-cannot-keep-funding-his-war-for-ever), which he is guaranteed to win. [The West’s wavering support](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/11/volodymyr-zelensky-tries-to-shake-congress-out-of-paralysis) for Ukraine provides another boost.

Still, Russia will find sustaining its huge outlays on the war—defence spending will be 6% of GDP in 2024—hard to keep up. Any attempt to recruit more troops in another [mobilisation campaign](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/24/how-russia-is-conscripting-men-to-fight-in-ukraine) would also be unpopular. Mr Putin wants to feed his war while disturbing the lives of his people as little as possible. The contradiction will only get more glaring.

### Guyana and Venezuela hold an awkward meeting

The presidents of Guyana and Venezuela are expected to meet in St Vincent and the Grenadines on Thursday to reduce tensions amid a long-running border dispute. A crisis over the issue has been largely manufactured by Nicolás Maduro. The Venezuelan autocrat [held a referendum](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/12/04/venezuelas-autocrat-nicolas-maduro-threatens-to-annex-guyana) on December 3rd asking whether the country should declare a region of Guyana, encompassing two-thirds of its landmass, part of Venezuela. The resounding answer from voters was “yes”.

That is unsurprising: most Venezuelans are taught at school that the land was robbed from them by a biased arbitration deal in 1899. The Guyanese say that the border’s demarcation was fairly settled between all parties and the matter is closed. Ifraan Ali, Guyana’s president, has suggested he agreed to the meeting on the condition that the countries’ shared frontier is not a matter for discussion. Yet Mr Maduro has already said that they should talk about precisely that.

### Will the ECB miss its moment?

Mistakes can be embarrassing. The European Central Bank’s primary mandate is to ensure price stability in the euro zone. Yet it is widely considered to have been late in raising interest rates when the inflation rate rose dramatically in 2022. Now its top brass want to make absolutely sure that inflation is dead before cutting rates. At its meeting on Thursday, the ECB will probably leave its reference rate at its record-high level of 4%, and push back against market expectations of large cuts in 2024 (see chart).

But those expectations are understandable. Inflation is coming down faster than expected. The [euro economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/12/europes-economy-is-in-a-bad-way-policymakers-need-to-react), services included, is probably in recession, according to survey indicators. And while wage growth remains high by the continent’s standards, there are early signs of a slowdown. It takes a while for rate cuts to have an effect. If the ECB misses its moment again, it risks prolonging the pain.

### Ethiopia’s debt problem

Ethiopian officials are expected to hold a call with their country’s international bondholders on Thursday. They are trying to avoid a default on a $1bn Eurobond due in late 2024. The call is the latest sign of the crisis facing Ethiopia’s once-promising economy. It also follows recent agreements with official creditors, including China, to suspend debt-service payments temporarily.

Like several other African countries, Ethiopia is struggling under a [swelling debt burden](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/16/africa-faces-a-mounting-debt-crisis), exacerbated by global factors such as covid-19. Since 2021 it has been seeking debt relief under the G20’s “Common Framework”, a loose accord among creditors. But progress towards a deal was derailed by a two-year [civil war](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/04/a-peace-deal-highlights-the-pointlessness-of-ethiopias-war) in the Tigray region, in which hundreds of thousands are thought to have died. Swathes of the country remain mired in ethnic conflict. Much now depends on whether Abiy Ahmed, the [controversial prime minister](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/02/ethiopias-prime-minister-wants-a-red-sea-harbour), can secure emergency funding from the IMF in early 2024. The clock is ticking.

### Football’s growing clout in America

In 1989 Paul Caligiuri netted a volley against Trinidad that sealed America’s place at its first football World Cup in 40 years. It was a seismic moment for the game in the country. America needed to qualify for the World Cup in 1990 to shore up its bid to host the tournament in 1994. That laid the foundation for the formation of Major League Soccer, the country’s professional league.

Mr Caligiuri’s strike became known as the “billion-dollar goal”, which is the title of a docuseries released on Paramount+ this week. It follows the sport’s transition in America from its beginnings as an immigrant’s game in the late 19th century to the moment Mr Caligiuri kickstarted an industry. In 1990 just 1% of Americans said football—or “soccer”—was their favourite sport. Now the figure is 8%, nearly as high as baseball. With America [co-hosting the World Cup in 2026](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/06/14/bickering-north-americans-win-the-right-to-host-footballs-world-cup), the “billion-dollar goal” looks ever more valuable.
