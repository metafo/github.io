Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Ukraine** launched [a missile strike](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis) on the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol in occupied Crimea. The governor of the city said that emergency services were battling a fire at the building. At least one person is missing, according to Russia’s defence ministry. Local officials also said Crimea was being hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack”. On Thursday, Russia conducted a large aerial assault on several Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, killing at least two people and injuring 20.

The **United Auto Workers**, one of America’s biggest unions, escalated its [strike](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/20/americas-big-car-firms-face-lengthy-strikes) against **GM** and **Stellantis** (whose biggest shareholder part-owns *The Economist’s* parent company). The union said that members would down tools at 38 parts-distribution centres owned by the carmakers from midday on Friday. It did not expand its strike against **Ford**, after making progress in negotiations.

**America** agreed to provide **Ukraine** with **ATACMS** missiles that can be used for long-range precision bombing, to aid the war against Russia. Joe Biden had informed Volodymyr Zelensky of the decision, according to media reports. Kyiv has long been asking the Biden administration for [the weapons](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/21/how-two-new-munitions-could-affect-the-war-in-ukraine), which Ukraine can use to target Russian-occupied territory and supply lines.

**Britain’s** antitrust regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, provisionally approved **Microsoft’s** acquisition of **Activision Blizzard**, a video-game developer, for $75bn. The watchdog had [blocked](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/04/26/britain-shoots-down-microsofts-69bn-activision-deal) the original deal in April, arguing that it could reduce choice for consumers. The companies submitted a new deal to the regulator last month, which took “the necessary steps” to address its concerns.

**Bob Menendez**, a senator from New Jersey, was indicted on corruption charges. Federal prosecutors allege that Mr Menendez, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accepted bribes in exchange for passing along sensitive information to Egypt, among other schemes. Mr Menendez, who denies wrongdoing, was previously tried on unrelated corruption charges, resulting in a hung jury.

**China** and **Syria** announced a new “strategic partnership” following talks between Xi Jinping, China’s president, and his Syrian counterpart, Bashar al-Assad, in the eastern city of Hangzhou. Mr Assad, who [re-established relations](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/09/after-12-years-of-blood-assads-syria-rejoins-the-arab-league) with the Arab League in May, is seeking to bring his regime out of more than a decade of international isolation since the start of Syria’s civil war.

Private-sector activity in the **euro zone** fell for the fourth consecutive month. The S&P Global’s purchasing managers’ index hit 47.1 in September, up from 46.7 in August—any figure below 50 signals contraction. That suggests the bloc’s economy will shrink this quarter as it struggles with higher energy costs and rising interest rates.

### Party-conference season kicks off in Bournemouth

For British politicos, autumn is the season for party conferences. These often boozy affairs bring together party bigwigs, donors and journalists to chat and, sometimes, disco. The Liberal Democrats, whose jamboree in Bournemouth starts on Saturday, like to gather round the piano and sing about land taxes. Members will cheer a recent by-election victory, their fourth since being reduced to just eleven seats in Parliament at the last election.

This year’s meet-ups will probably be the last before a general election (which must be held no later than January 2025). That makes it crunch time for the ruling Conservatives, who languish 20 points behind Labour in the polls. At their conference in Manchester expect Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, to launch some aggressive attacks on the opposition. Meanwhile, Labour’s leader Sir Keir Starmer—fresh from [hobnobbing](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/18/france-rolls-out-the-red-carpet-for-britain) with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron—will use his get-together in Liverpool to audition as prime minister-in-waiting.

### Anniversary of a bail-out

Saturday marks 25 years since Long-Term Capital Management completed one of the most spectacular falls from grace in Wall Street’s history. In the mid-1990s it was the hottest hedge fund going, with a partnership that included two Nobel laureates and a superstar team of bond traders poached from Salomon Brothers, an investment bank. Between 1994 and 1997 it made its initial investors returns of more than 30% a year and never lost money two months in a row.

Then, in 1998, the wheels came off. Owing in part to the Asian financial crisis, LTCM lost 90% of its capital at a stroke. At the New York Federal Reserve’s urging, a consortium of Wall Street banks arranged a $3.6bn bail-out to stop the fund collapsing and, perhaps, taking its trading counterparties with it. The Fed’s involvement raised eyebrows over whether a hedge fund ought to have been treated as “too big to fail”—a debate that is revived whenever financial institutions are [bailed out](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/03/13/americas-government-steps-in-to-protect-depositors-at-silicon-valley-bank) today.

### The rise of e-sports at the Asian Games

The Asian Games finally start in Hangzhou, an eastern Chinese city, on Saturday after the covid-19 pandemic delayed the event by a year. Fans will be rewarded for their patience. The games are bigger than ever: 45 countries and 12,400 athletes will compete—more than at the Tokyo Olympics in 2022.

The event will also be the first of its size to feature [e-sports](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/03/20/the-rise-and-rise-of-e-sports), or competitive video-gaming. Gamers will compete in seven events, including popular games such as FIFA Online 4, a football favourite, and League of Legends, an online fantasy epic. But another huge sports event remains hesitant about embracing e-sports. The International Olympic Committee cites concerns such as violence in video games, despite scant evidence that in-play cruelty spills over into real life and the fact that the Olympics happily include traditional combat sports like boxing. Competitive gaming has an audience of millions and provides huge revenue opportunities, from media rights to sponsorship. The Olympics’ missed opportunity may prove the Asian Games’ gain.

### A warrior of performance art in London

For most, risking immolation is an act of desperation—or madness. But for [Marina Abramovic](https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/09/05/the-power-of-performance-art), it is art. For over 50 years the world’s best-known performance artist has made her body a canvas, enduring exhaustion and humiliation in the pursuit of a connection with audiences. A retrospective of her work opens on Saturday at the Royal Academy in London.

Ms Abramovic is the first woman to have a solo show in the main galleries. Death and desire—the extremes of human nature—fascinate her. In 1974, in her native Belgrade, Serbia, she lay at the centre of a flaming star, and passed out from the smoke. In the same year the artist placed herself at visitors’ mercy: one stripped her to the waist, another held a pistol to her throat. The experience turned part of her hair white. In today’s digital age, her style of art is refreshing, stomach-jolting—and impossible to ignore.

### Weekend profile: RAW, India’s intelligence agency

Chanakya, a renowned writer and thinker in the fourth-century BC and an advisor to the Mauryan emperor in ancient India, was one of the earliest advocates of espionage as an essential part of statecraft. But India’s covert powers have historically focused on South Asia. The [recent accusation](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/19/a-devastating-accusation-by-justin-trudeau-against-india) from Canada that Indian agents were involved in the murder in Vancouver of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist, could be a sign of new, global ambitions.

After independence, the Indian government relied on the colonial-era Intelligence Bureau (IB) for domestic and foreign spy work. That changed in 1968 when Indira Gandhi, then prime minister, asked R.N. Kao, an IB official who had helped independent Ghana establish its first spy service, to set up a new agency. The result was the Research & Analysis Wing (RAW). In homage, its early officers called themselves “Kaoboys”.

RAW quickly became an important instrument of Indian power. It was critical during a war with Pakistan in 1971, when it helped arm and train Bengali insurgents who eventually carved out the state of Bangladesh. In subsequent decades it influenced politics, armed rebels—notably Tamil Tiger separatists in Sri Lanka and Tajik warlords in Afghanistan—and meddled in the Indian diasporas. Its paramilitary unit, manned largely by Tibetan refugees and known as the Special Frontier Force, played a role in recent [Sino-Indian skirmishing](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/20/what-the-china-india-detente-means-for-the-west) in the Himalayas. And, like many spy agencies, it participates in the sensitive conversations that diplomats cannot: RAW officials played a key role in backchannel talks with Pakistan’s military and insurgent groups.

In fact, the service has near-mythological status in Pakistan, whose leaders see India’s hidden hand behind every mishap. Yet RAW has a middling reputation for actual intelligence gathering, and largely focuses on analysis and covert operations in countries like Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

RAW has been accused of bumping off enemies in South Asia; never so far afield as Canada.“It is out of character for RAW,” says one former intelligence official with knowledge of the agency. India, which called the allegation “absurd”, expelled Canada’s intelligence chief in Delhi and suspended new visas for Canadians. As India grows more confident on the world stage, it may be an indication of things to come.
