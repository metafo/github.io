### September 26, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Hollywood writers** [agreed on](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/25/hollywoods-strike-enters-its-final-act-as-writers-reach-a-deal) a “tentative” three-year contract with film and television companies that could end a 146-day **strike**. The Writers Guild of America said the deal, which must be approved by its 11,500 members, was “exceptional” and would provide “meaningful gains and protections”. Hollywood’s [writers](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/05/10/writers-on-strike-beware-hollywood-has-changed-for-ever) have sought better compensation, as well as protection from artificial intelligence. The SAG-AFTRA union, which represents 150,000 actors, remains on strike.

**Ukrainian** officials claimed that the commander of the **Russian Black Sea Fleet** was one of the 34 officers killed in a missile strike on the fleet’s headquarters last Friday. Ukraine also said that at least six people were killed by an overnight Russian attack on **Odessa**, Ukraine’s largest [port](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/27/why-is-odessa-important-to-both-ukraine-and-russia). Ukraine’s air force said it destroyed 19 drones and 11 cruise missiles.

**Saudi Arabia** will place its nuclear activities under comprehensive safeguarding by the UN atomic watchdog. The long-anticipated move means the country can start operating its first reactor. Muhammad bin Salman, the country’s crown prince, has previously said that Saudi Arabia would look to match the nuclear activities of Iran, a major rival, which in recent years appears to have expanded[ its nuclear facilities](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/30/iran-puts-its-nuclear-programme-beyond-the-reach-of-american-bombs).

**Egypt** announced that a presidential election will be held in December. Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, a field-marshal who took over in a coup ten years ago, won the country’s [last such election](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/03/30/abdel-fattah-al-sisi-wins-a-second-term-in-egypt)—a sham with only one other candidate—with 92% of the vote. Mr Sisi embarked on an ambitious investment plan during his decade in power; it has crashed the Egyptian pound and is fuelling [growing discontent](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/06/15/egyptians-are-disgruntled-with-president-abdel-fattah-al-sisi).

**Bob Menendez**, a senator from **New Jersey** [indicted last week](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/22/bob-menendez-a-prominent-senator-faces-bribery-charges) on corruption charges, said he would not resign. He has already stepped down as chair of the Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee—as required by the chamber’s rules—but insisted that after “all the facts are presented” he would be “exonerated”. Many of his fellow Democrats have called for him to resign.

**America** recognised the **Cook Islands** and **Niue**, a set of islands in the Pacific, as sovereign nations, during the US-Pacific Islands Forum Leader’s Summit in Washington, DC. The Biden administration, which is competing with China for influence over the[ strategically important](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/15/how-the-pentagon-thinks-about-americas-strategy-in-the-pacific) Pacific island nations, will establish full diplomatic relations with the countries. America has also committed to greater investment.

Police in **Britain** opened an investigation into comedian **Russell Brand** after receiving “a number of allegations of sexual offences” following an [investigation](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/19/russell-brand-was-the-norm-in-the-nasty-noughties) by the Sunday Times and Channel 4, in which several women accused Mr Brand of crimes including sexual assault and rape. Mr Brand has not been charged and denies all allegations.

### Crimea’s importance in the war

President Vladimir Putin’s war has come to [Crimea](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/25/war-has-arrived-in-crimea) in earnest. On Friday two Ukrainian missiles smashed into the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. Ukraine claims they killed the fleet’s commander and another 33 officers. Russian authorities have since started turning on air-raid sirens, which they had previously avoided, lest they acknowledge the threat.

Ukraine’s strategists identify Crimea, the peninsula [annexed](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2014/03/06/the-end-of-the-beginning) by Russia in 2014, as the invaders’ Achilles heel. It is crucial to Russia’s ability to project power and hold on to occupied territories, but also vulnerable to being cut off. Since the summer Ukraine has massively stepped up strikes, hitting military bases, air bases, and command-and-control centres. More than once it has damaged the Kerch bridge, a vital access point. But Russia is making tactical adjustments in response, such as moving some ships to safer ports. The psychological importance of Crimea to Mr Putin’s rule means he is likely to cling on.

### Another South Korean politician faces arrest

On Tuesday a South Korean court will consider whether to issue an arrest warrant for Lee Jae-myung, leader of the opposition Democratic Party and chief rival to [Yoon Suk-yeol](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/03/12/south-koreas-new-leader-must-restore-his-citizens-faith-in-politics), the president, who leads the conservative People Power Party. Prosecutors have been after Mr Lee for some time for alleged graft and directing money to [North Korea](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/07/27/south-korea-has-given-up-on-talking-to-the-north). But they cannot arrest a sitting MP without parliament’s approval, and Mr Lee’s left-leaning party has a majority. In February, parliament voted not to allow his arrest. But a second vote on September 21st went against him.

Mr Lee says that the president and the prosecutors’ office, which Mr Yoon used to run, is on a witch-hunt. Yet the more recent vote, in which a significant number of his own party chose not to protect him, suggests more widespread discontent. With a parliamentary election looming in April, some Democratic Party parliamentarians are trying to rid themselves of a controversial leader.

### America’s resilient property market

The [housing market](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/12/is-the-global-housing-slump-over) in America is simultaneously frozen and hot. With mortgage rates above 7%, their highest in more than two decades, it is exceedingly expensive to borrow money to buy homes. Predictably, demand has been weakening. But people who already own homes have little desire to sell: many obtained cheap long-term fixed mortgages before the Federal Reserve raised rates to battle inflation, and would lose these deals if they sold.

The result is that the number of homes being offered for sale is low, which in turn is driving up prices. When the latest nationwide index from S&P Case-Shiller, which tracks the prices of American homes, is published on Tuesday it is expected to show a sixth straight month of [rising prices](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/30/how-can-american-house-prices-still-be-rising). Separate figures are also likely to point to strong sales of [new homes](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/06/the-growing-global-movement-to-restrain-house-prices). With so few existing houses available, many of those braving the elevated mortgage rates to make purchases are opting for new-builds.

### Biden and Trump visit the picketers

President Joe Biden will visit Michigan on Tuesday to spend time with workers on strike. [Auto workers](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/24/does-the-car-workers-strike-threaten-americas-industrial-boom) in Detroit are in dispute with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis (whose part-owner is also a part-owner of *The Economist*). No sitting president has ever joined a picket line before. Donald Trump, Mr Biden’s potential rival for the presidency next year, intends to go to Detroit on Wednesday. He may meet some pro-Trump strikers, although he would not be welcomed by most on the picket lines.

The strike, which started ten days ago, is mostly over pay. The United Auto Workers union wants a big rise; so far the manufacturers have offered only modest ones. Negotiations remain stuck, though the UAW may soon end action against Ford, which has offered more. Mr Trump, however, blames the dispute on [electric cars](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/04/14/an-electric-shock), which he accuses Mr Biden of foisting on American consumers, to the detriment of Detroit’s workers. Either way, strikers hope that all the political attention will help their cause.

### China’s alternative history

Xi Jinping, China’s leader, takes [history](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/06/15/xi-jinping-reaches-into-chinas-ancient-history-for-a-new-claim-to-rule)—or his [version](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/09/21/how-china-uses-unesco-to-rewrite-history) of it—very seriously. Even at the height of the covid-19 pandemic, the Communist Party he rules still took the time to issue a 36,000-character “magnificent epic” about China under communism, culminating in Mr Xi’s own “glorious era.” Irritating details such as the bloodshed of the [Cultural Revolution](https://www.economist.com/china/2016/05/14/it-was-the-worst-of-times) and around [Tiananmen Square](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/06/04/what-happened-around-tiananmen-square-on-june-4th-1989) in 1989 were omitted. Like all authoritarians, Mr Xi knows that who controls the past controls the future.

In “Sparks”, published on Tuesday, Ian Johnson, an American journalist, showcases China’s “underground historians” who challenge official history. Often motivated by personal experiences, some academics, artists, film-makers and journalists take enormous risks to visit scenes of past horror and to interview survivors. They share their discoveries in *samizdat* form and online. Mr Johnson’s ability to gain the trust of his subjects is evident in his compellingly written work. The result is a rare insight into the darkest corners of communism.
