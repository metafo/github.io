Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

------

A global-hunger monitor warned that famine could be “imminent” for 300,000 people in northern Gaza, where 70% of residents are experiencing severe food shortage. The group of experts—who supply information to UN agencies—projects that 1.1m people will face “catastrophic conditions” by July. Gaza’s health ministry has said that more than 27 people, mostly children, have died from a lack of food. Earlier Israel’s army attacked the **al-Shifa hospital** in Gaza city, where it said that “senior Hamas terrorists” were using the building as a base. Israel said it killed 20 gunmen and apprehended 200 others. Tanks and bulldozers were deployed around the hospital, which is only barely operational.

**China** reported stronger industrial activity than expected, with production rising by 7% year-on-year in January and February, the fastest rate in two years. But the economic snapshot also showed that [China’s long-term challenges](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/17/chinas-population-is-shrinking-and-its-economy-is-losing-ground) persist. The property sector remains in the doldrums: investment fell by 9% year on year, and the number of new residential projects dipped 30% from a year earlier.

America condemned Russia’s sham [presidential election](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/17/vladimir-putins-sham-re-election-is-notable-only-for-the-protests) as “not free or fair” after early results showed Vladimir Putin won 87% of the vote, allowing him another six-year term. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said Mr Putin was “simulating another election”. The victorious Mr Putin warned NATO that it would be “one step away” from a third world war should it confront Russia directly.

A Supreme Court justice indefinitely blocked a [controversial immigration law](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/25/the-bold-texas-plan-to-stop-migrants-has-hit-a-wall) in **Texas** from coming into force while legal challenges play out. The law would allow state police to arrest people suspected of illegally entering from Mexico, powers that the Biden administration maintains are reserved for the federal government. A lower court had earlier ruled that the law could take effect on March 9th.

**North Korea** fired short-range [ballistic missiles](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/03/05/north-korea-is-arming-russia-and-threatening-war-with-south-korea) towards its eastern waters, according to Japan. The launch came days after South Korea and America’s armed forces finished eleven days of combined military drills. **Kim Jong Un**, North Korea’s dictator, has criticised joint exercises in the past as preparations for an invasion.

**Donald Trump’s** lawyers told the judge overseeing his civil-fraud case—who ordered the former president and his adult sons [to pay $464m in damages](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/17/the-consequences-of-donald-trumps-huge-fine-for-fraud)—that he has been unable to find an insurance company to underwrite the bond. The court can seize Mr Trump’s assets if he does not pay by March 25th; his lawyers asked for a reprieve while he appeals against the judgment.

**Cocoa futures** in New York reached an all-time high. The [commodity’s price](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/02/28/why-chocolate-is-becoming-much-more-expensive) has soared by 98% since the start of 2024. Extreme weather is partly to blame: a drought swept West Africa since last November, where most of the world’s cocoa is grown. Supply has also been hit by price caps set by West African governments that have discouraged farmers from investing in their plantations.

**Figure of the day:** 20%, the share of American students who were diagnosed with or treated for depression in 2019, up from 10% a decade earlier. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/03/15/how-worried-should-people-be-about-generation-z).

### A monetary moment for Japan

The Bank of Japan may announce its first interest-rate increase in 17 years when its latest policy meeting ends on Tuesday. The BoJ has for decades stood out among central banks for its [unconventional monetary policy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/28/the-bank-of-japan-jolts-global-markets); it remains the last with a negative policy rate, at minus 0.1%.

That era looks likely to end. Japan’s key inflation measure has exceeded the BoJ’s target of 2% for 22 months, but wage growth has lagged. Policymakers have delayed raising rates until they can be sure that prices and wages will move together. Data from annual wage negotiations between trade unions and large firms suggest record gains for workers for the second year running. But even if the BoJ does end negative interest rates and [yield-curve control](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/02/how-japan-poses-a-threat-to-the-global-financial-system) (a tool to control long-term bond yields) its overall stance is likely to [remain accommodative](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/02/14/the-bank-of-japans-new-governor-ueda-kazuo-marks-a-break-with-tradition). Economists expect rate rises to be gradual, and the policy rate to settle around 0.5% or lower.

### America’s power circuit connects

Energy-industry leaders in America’s oil capital, Houston, are discussing how to keep the lights on in an uncertain world. Oil and gas bosses who have gathered for S&P Global’s CERAWeek will swap notes with senators and policymakers. They will discuss balancing supply and demand as energy markets shift to cleaner fuels, the effect of borrowing costs on investment and navigating geopolitics.

Last week Shell announced it was planning a [slower phase-out](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024/03/11/can-big-oil-run-in-reverse) of carbon emissions. Like other oil giants, it cites low returns on investments in renewable energy and high interest rates. There is also uncertainty about how America’s energy policy will shape up after this year’s presidential election. In January the Biden administration paused new licences for exporters of liquefied natural gas, which industry executives see as a means of firming up supply as markets transition to renewable energy. Meanwhile, advocates of alternatives, like hydrogen and nuclear energy, have also flocked to oil country to make the most of these currents.

### Jacob Zuma is back

A court case in South Africa on Tuesday could have a huge influence on the general elections scheduled for May 29th. The [ruling](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/22/business-leaders-fear-that-south-africa-risks-becoming-a-failed-state) African National Congress had been expected to win enough votes to dominate a coalition government with smaller parties. Then came a bombshell. In December [Jacob Zuma](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/02/19/why-jacob-zuma-resigned), South Africa’s president from 2009 to 2018, announced a new party, named after the armed wing of the ANC during apartheid, uMkhonto Wesizwe (MK).

Mr Zuma will not become president again. But he could win enough votes to put his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, in a tight spot. If the ANC receives about 40% of the vote, as polls suggest, it may be forced into an unsavoury alliance with populists, such as the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters and indeed MK. An alternative would be a government of national unity with the Democratic Alliance. The ANC has asked an electoral court to bar MK from the ballot on a technicality. If it loses, the game is on.

### Inflation hopes in Canada

Canadians started the year with a spot of unexpected relief, as the annual inflation rate dipped from 3.4% in December to 2.9% in January. That is just inside the Canadian central bank’s inflation target range of between 1% and 3%. On Tuesday new figures for February will show whether that drop will be sustained.

Polls suggest that voters went sour on Justin Trudeau, the Liberal Party prime minister, as prices began climbing in 2021. Annual inflation went up from 0.7% in December 2020 and peaked at 8.1% in June 2022. [Pierre Poilievre](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/09/15/canadas-conservatives-pick-a-brainy-brawler-as-leader), the opposition leader, has blamed the government’s economic incompetence for what he calls “Justinflation”. Mr Trudeau will hope that easing inflation may persuade the central bank to begin cutting interest rates after it had jerked them up by 4.75 percentage points in under 18 months. That might help win back some of his supporters. For now, his Liberals trail 18 points behind Mr Poilievre’s Conservatives in the run-up to [next year’s election](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/justin-trudeau-wants-a-fourth-term-as-canadas-prime-minister).

### March Madness begins

The 2024 men’s March Madness tips off on Tuesday in Dayton, Ohio. The annual knockout basketball tournament features teams from American universities; the women’s contest also starts later this week. For players, a star turn can be a quick route into the professional National Basketball Association (WNBA for women). In 2019, for example, Zion Williamson, a power forward, went from his freshman season at Duke University to become the first player drafted that year by the NBA—in other words, the most sought-after recruit.

For viewers, the tournaments offer a particular delight—one that tends to bemuse non-Americans. Fans fill out brackets predicting the outcomes of each of the games (67 for men and 68 for women) and compete to see who nets the closest calls. The tournament is known for its upsets; this year the team to beat is UConn, which also took the trophy in 2023. While in office, President Barack Obama would discuss his bracket every year on ESPN, a sports channel, displaying a relatively conservative line in his predictions but disarmingly detailed knowledge about the amateur competition.
