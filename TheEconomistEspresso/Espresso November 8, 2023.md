## The world in brief

### November 8, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

The **Israel Defence Forces** are fighting “in the heart of **Gaza city**”, according to the head of the Southern Command. Israel gave the city’s residents four hours to flee south ahead of a [ground advance](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/06/israeli-soldiers-fight-to-reach-hamass-headquarters). Meanwhile Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said that more than 10,300 people have been killed in the enclave since the war began. Just 569 aid trucks—none carrying fuel—have entered Gaza, according to the UN’s humanitarian office.

**António Costa**, Portugal’s prime minister, resigned after police searched his official residence and several government buildings. Prosecutors said that Mr Costa is being investigated as part of a corruption probe linked to [lithium-exploration](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/04/20/why-crashing-lithium-prices-will-not-make-electric-cars-cheaper) schemes and a green-hydrogen mega-project. Mr Costa’s chief of staff was detained earlier, and his infrastructure minister was also named as a formal suspect in the investigations.

**NATO** allies suspended the operation of the [Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/01/21/russia-quits-the-open-skies-treaty) in Europe. The cold-war-era pact prevented signatories from massing forces near mutual borders. The move was prompted by **Russia’s** withdrawal from the treaty, which the Kremlin said was partly a response to NATO’s expansion near its borders. Jake Sullivan, America’s national security adviser, denounced Russia’s “disregard for arms control”.

Democrats in **America’s** **Senate** voted down a bill that would have authorised military aid to Israel but not to **Ukraine**. The emergency funding package was earlier passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Separately, four top officials from the Biden administration urged Congressional leaders to pass $11.8bn in economic aid to Ukraine—a proposal that seems [even more anathema](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/26/the-republican-party-no-longer-believes-america-is-the-essential-nation) to Republicans than supplying weapons.

**German industrial production** fell by 1.4% month on month in September—the fourth such consecutive decrease. The steeper-than-expected slump was largely driven by weaknesses in the automotive industry, which manufactured 5% fewer vehicles. Production in the pharmaceutical industry also declined, by 9.2%. [Germany’s economy](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/17/is-germany-once-again-the-sick-man-of-europe) is in trouble: it shrank by 0.1% in the third quarter, increasing the risk of [recession](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/the-world-economy-is-defying-gravity-that-cannot-last).

**Saudi Aramco** reported a third-quarter net profit of $32.6bn, a drop of 23% compared with the [same period in 2022](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/03/16/saudi-aramco-makes-an-eye-popping-160bn-in-profit). The decline was driven by lower crude prices and a fall in volumes sold. Still, those decreases were partly offset by a reduction in production royalties, which helped the oil giant marginally beat analysts’ expectations. The company’s share price ticked up in early trading.

The **European Space Agency** published the first images taken by the Euclid [telescope](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/29/how-is-the-james-webb-space-telescope-changing-astronomy), which it launched in July. They included unprecedented pictures of the Horsehead Nebula, a dark nebula which is part of a giant star-forming region only 1,375 light-years away from Earth. **Euclid** is on a six-year mission to create a 3D map of more than a third of the sky, by observing billions of galaxies.

### Another Trumpless Republican debate

A shrinking Republican presidential primary field will debate for a third time on Wednesday. Mike Pence, the former vice-president, recently ended his campaign. That leaves only five remaining candidates who have both reached the minimum donor and polling thresholds and signalled that they are willing to attend: Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie, [Nikki Haley](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/01/nikki-haley-like-other-long-shots-sees-a-path-to-victory), Vivek Ramaswamy and Tim Scott.

Mr DeSantis, governor of Florida, recently received the endorsement of Kim Reynolds, his counterpart in Iowa. But Mrs Haley, a former ambassador to the United Nations, has risen in polls after strong debate performances. She will aim to show voters, and donors, that she can take on Donald Trump, who will again skip the event.

“If Donald Trump can summon the balls to show up to the debate, I’ll wear a boot on my head,” Mr DeSantis taunted. The chances are indeed slim: the former president [sees little gain](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/24/how-donald-trump-won-the-debate-he-skipped) from attending when he commands support from nearly 60% of Republican primary voters.

### The path to EU enlargement

On Wednesday the European Commission unveils its assessment of the reforms aspiring EU member states have undertaken to join the bloc. The most prominent candidate is Ukraine. But others hoping for good news include Georgia, Moldova, Serbia, and a further five countries in the Western Balkans. After a decade with no enlargement, the club’s existing 27 members are [now serious](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/28/the-eu-is-finally-rebooting-the-enlargement-machine) about allowing new countries in, largely to [fend off](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/the-war-in-ukraine-is-a-powerful-reason-to-enlarge-and-improve-the-eu) geopolitical encroachment by Russia.

The commission’s annual scorecard will be particularly significant for Ukraine, which became a candidate country only in June 2022. European officials expect a mostly positive report for the country after the commission’s boss, Ursula von der Leyen, visited the capital, Kyiv, last weekend. That should translate, by the end of the year, into Ukraine starting protracted negotiations about joining the bloc, if national governments agree. Other aspirant members, notably [Georgia](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/06/why-is-georgia-struggling-to-join-the-eu), will probably receive a more critical assessment.

### Disney girds for battle

Call it “The Nightmare before Christmas”. Disney’s boss, [Bob Iger](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/16/bob-iger-makes-big-changes-at-disney), unveils the firm’s yearly earnings on Wednesday. At the same time he is fending off a potential boardroom challenge from Nelson Peltz, an activist investor who has renewed [hostilities](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/02/08/disney-will-cut-7000-jobs-as-it-restructures-its-business) after a nine-month detente. Mr Peltz appears to have lost patience with Mr Iger’s response to numerous strategic quandaries. They include what to do with declining cable assets such as ESPN, a sports broadcaster, and how best to absorb Hulu, a streaming service of which Disney is taking full ownership.

Disney’s share price has languished since Mr Iger came out of retirement last November. Yet he strengthened his position this week with the appointment of Hugh Johnston as chief financial officer. Mr Johnston has handy experience: while at his previous employer, PepsiCo, he helped repel a challenge from Mr Peltz’s Trian Fund Management. Mr Iger may also have his eye on Mr Johnston as a successor.

### Airbus is cruising

The steady recovery of the [aviation industry](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/05/14/the-aviation-industry-wants-to-be-net-zero-but-not-yet) will be in evidence on Wednesday when Airbus releases third-quarter results. The European aerospace consortium is expected to announce that revenues and profits comfortably exceeded those for the same quarter last year. Deliveries of passenger jets are continuing to grow as demand for travel bounces back after the pandemic. Airbus will probably reiterate plans to supply 720 new planes this year, compared with 661 in 2022.

Airbus wants to rebuild supply chains in order to reach a production rate of 75 planes per month in 2026. To bolster the effort, the firm recently created a new role: head of its commercial-aircraft division. Christian Scherer, a German, will take the job, which is one rung below that of the overall boss, Guillaume Faury, a Frenchman. Franco-German divisions have been a problem for Airbus in the past. But the appointment of Mr Scherer, a company veteran, is unlikely to reopen old wounds.

### America’s growing love of country music

“I only talk to God when I need a favour, and I only pray when I ain’t got no prayer.” Jelly Roll (pictured), one of country music’s hottest artists, will sing those words to kick off the Country Music Association awards in Nashville on Wednesday. Every autumn legends and newcomers descend on Music City to perform their biggest hits and crown the next batch of country royalty.

This year more people outside country’s heartland are taking notice. Young crooners, led by [Morgan Wallen](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/09/01/thanks-to-morgan-wallen-country-musics-popularity-has-surged), a heartthrob from Tennessee, are reinventing the genre’s sound and bringing in swathes of new fans. Around 150m Americans listen to country music at least once a month. That is more than triple the number that tune in to an hour or more of Fox News, America’s most-watched cable network. This year a whopping 36% of streams of Spotify’s top 50 songs in America have been country numbers. In 2016 country’s share was just 2%.
