The **UN’s** agency for Palestinian refugees said that it would be unable to continue its operations in **Gaza** if it doesn’t receive fuel by Wednesday night. **Israel** has blocked fuel from being delivered through Egypt. It has so far allowed the entry of only 54 trucks, containing [food and medical supplies](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/23/life-in-gaza-is-a-series-of-calculations-how-much-water-do-you-really-need). On Monday, **Hamas** freed two elderly Israeli women it had taken **hostage** during its attack on Israel on October 7th. The militant group is still holding more than 200 people in Gaza, according to the Israel Defence Forces.

**Israel’s** ambassador to the UN called on **An****tó****nio Guterres** to resign after the [organisation’s chief](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2020/11/17/antonio-guterres-wants-to-avoid-a-great-fracture) said that Hamas’ attack “did not happen in a vacuum” and characterised Israel’s bombardment of Gaza as “deeply alarming”. Mr Guterres—who also condemned Hamas’ actions—urged a ceasefire. Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, reportedly cancelled a planned meeting with Mr Guterres.

The **International Energy Agency** predicted that demand for oil, gas and coal will peak before 2030—if governments meet their current [climate commitments](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/11/the-global-backlash-against-climate-policies-has-begun). It cited reduced demand for fossil fuels from China and the rise of electric cars, which it expects will account for over a third of new car sales by 2030. The forecast diverges from that of OPEC, a group of oil-producing countries, which expects oil demand to continue rising until 2045.

**Tom Emmer** dropped out of the speakership race in America’s **House of Representatives** just hours after Republicans nominated him for the job. Mr Emmer, who backed certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, failed to secure the support of hardline Republicans—and was harshly criticised by Donald Trump on social media. He was the third Republican nominee for the post in [less than a month](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/19/americas-republicans-cannot-agree-on-a-speaker-good).

**General Li Shangfu**, China’s defence minister, was dismissed from his role, having mysteriously disappeared from the public eye two months ago. The Chinese government did not give a reason for his removal, but General Li has reportedly been under investigation for corruption. It is the latest in a [series of dismissals](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/09/15/the-mystery-surrounding-chinas-missing-defence-minister) in the upper ranks of the country’s military.

More than 30 American states sued **Meta**, which owns Instagram and Facebook, accusing the tech giant of harming young users. They argue that Meta is breaking consumer-protection laws by intentionally designing “psychologically manipulative” features for its platforms and violating federal law by gathering children’s data without parents’ consent. Meta responded that it had created more than 30 tools “to support teens and their families”.

**South Korea** detained a group of **North Koreans** seeking to [defect](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/27/north-koreas-borders-are-creaking-open) from their repressive homeland. The North Koreans—reportedly a group of four—traversed the waters off the east coast of the Korean peninsula in a small wooden boat. They will be eligible for South Korean citizenship subject to passing an investigation by the country’s security services.

### Hong Kong leader’s happy talk

John Lee, Hong Kong’s chief executive, will give his annual policy address on Wednesday. He will focus on two themes: “unity” and the economy. Mr Lee wants Hong Kongers to be more jolly. He launched a campaign in April called “Happy Hong Kong”, which involves staging events like carnivals in an effort to banish perceptions of the city as one of protests, repression and covid isolation.

But his administration’s idea of harmony also involves locking up [scores](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/09/hong-kong-starts-its-largest-national-security-trial) of opposition politicians and wielding a draconian national-security law. Shortly after the “Happy” campaign’s launch, the government put HK$1m ($128,000) [bounties](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/07/04/hong-kong-puts-a-price-on-the-heads-of-democracy-activists) on the heads of eight pro-democracy activists who fled abroad, including an Australian citizen.

Hong Kong’s economy, meanwhile, has shrunk in three of the past four years. It will grow somewhat this year, but is being constrained by a weak housing market and by economic problems on the mainland. The labour market must also replace droves of unjolly workers who have fled over the past four years.

### Meta’s bet on AI

On Wednesday Meta, Facebook’s parent company, will report its quarterly results. So far the firm has had a good year. Its share price has risen by more than 160%, more than that of any other big tech company. But that is partly because Meta’s share slump in 2022 was deeper than its rivals’.

Between September 2021 and November 2022 Meta’s stock market value fell by three-quarters due to falling advertising revenue. From the second quarter of this year, however, ad sales have begun to recover. They grew by 12% to $31bn in the three months to July. Meta’s share price has also been helped by cost-cutting.

Investors will try to size up Meta’s new [artificial-intelligence-powered products](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/05/so-long-iphone-generative-ai-needs-a-new-device), which include AI assistants and text-generated digital stickers (emojis of sorts). AI is expensive to run, but Meta hopes these features will create more engagement among users—and more advertising revenue. If Meta’s AI bet is right it could soar again. If not, another slump may loom.

### Israel’s hostage crisis and the government

Hamas has so far released four hostages they abducted when they attacked Israel on October 7th. The Americans handled the negotiations, using as intermediaries Hamas’s Qatari patrons. The relief felt by the freed hostages’ [families](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/20/their-relatives-are-missing-after-hamass-attack-now-theyre-tracking-them-down-themselves) is mixed with concern for the 220 known hostages still in Gaza—and anger that the Israeli government isn’t more involved in trying to secure their release.

Relatives have taken matters into their own hands, setting up a headquarters in Tel Aviv staffed by hundreds of volunteers. Teams of former diplomats are liaising with foreign governments. Former Israeli spy chiefs are serving as negotiators. Israeli tech companies have combed through thousands of hours of social-media footage for any sign of the hostages.

Pressure from the families has forced the government, which was originally inclined to rush into Gaza without regard for the hostages’ safety, to announce that their rescue is a “top priority”. If that proves not to be the case, the families warn, they will protest in the streets.

### Deutsche Bank’s successful run

Rising rates have been a boon for European banks. High net-interest margins have offset weak investment-banking activity. On Wednesday Deutsche Bank will report its latest quarterly earnings. After reporting huge losses in 2019, the German lender restructured. It has avoided losses in every quarter since the second half of 2020.

Investors will be wondering whether the bank can continue to benefit from higher rates as economies slow and company defaults rise. Deutsche Bank’s [investment-banking](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/31/germanys-economic-model-is-sputtering-so-are-its-banks) division is also in the spotlight. Lower market volatility has reduced trading revenues among European investment banks and a slump in corporate dealmaking has hurt income from fees. Deutsche Bank has coped better with these problems than some of its competitors. It is even increasing its bet on some areas of investment banking. This month it finalised its $500m acquisition of Numis, a British corporate broker.

### Indonesia prepares for elections

Indonesia’s presidential hopefuls must announce their bids by Wednesday. The presidential election is scheduled for February 14th 2024. The winner will have big shoes to fill. The incumbent, Joko Widodo, known as [Jokowi](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/07/what-will-indonesia-look-like-after-jokowi-leaves), is one of the best-liked leaders in the world.

Three candidates are expected. They include Ganjar Pranowo, a former governor of central Java, who is polling second. Anies Baswedan, a former governor of Jakarta, the capital, is behind him. The leading contender is Prabowo Subianto, Indonesia’s defence minister. Mr Prabowo has lost to Jokowi twice. A former military man, he has been accused of allowing human-rights abuses in East Timor in the 1980s, and of kidnapping pro-democracy activist students in the 1990s. Mr Prabowo has always strongly denied the allegations. Adroitly, he has named Jokowi’s eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming, as his running mate. Although Jokowi has yet to endorse a candidate, many observers take Mr Gibran’s nomination to be a sign that Jokowi backs Mr Prabowo. That may be one reason why he is the front-runner.
