## The world in brief

### January 18, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**America** redesignated the **Houthis**, a Yemen-based [group](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/12/who-are-the-houthis-the-group-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea) that for weeks has been launching attacks in the Red Sea, a terrorist organisation. The Biden administration removed the group from its foreign terrorist list three years ago, to smooth aid deliveries to Yemen. The new measures—which will come into force in 30 days—will require American institutions to freeze funds to the militant group.

**Pakistan** recalled its ambassador from **Iran**, and temporarily suspended all high-level visits between the two countries. The move came after [Iran](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/14/irans-regime-is-weaker-than-it-looks-and-therefore-more-pliable) carried out air strikes on targets in Pakistan. Iranian reports claimed the strikes were directed at bases for Jaish al-Adl, a Sunni militant group. Pakistan condemned the attack as “illegal” and said two children were killed and three others were injured.

Rishi Sunak, **Britain’s** prime minister, quelled a rebellion from hard-right Tory MPs and passed his **Rwanda** bill. The bill [attempts to circumvent](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/12/14/the-magical-thinking-behind-britains-rwanda-bill) a Supreme Court ruling that Mr Sunak’s plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlawful, by declaring that Rwanda is safe. The rebels did not think the bill, which will now go to the House of Lords, went far enough.

**Russian** police cracked down on a large protest in the central region of Bashkortostan after a civil-rights activist was jailed. Reports estimated that thousands of people joined the protest, making it one of the largest demonstrations in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of people have been detained for opposing the war.

Three people died and nearly 80 were injured in an explosion in Ibadan, a major city in south-western **Nigeria**. The blast was caused by explosives that illegal miners had stored in a house. Illegal mining is rampant in mineral-rich Nigeria. A government minister said that it would “tighten regulations” around storing explosives pending a report into the blast’s causes.

**Apple** overtook **Samsung** to become the largest seller of smartphones in the world in 2023, according to a report by International Data Corp. Phone sales from Samsung were down 13.6%, while iPhone shipments grew by 3.7%, according to IDC. The [smartphone industry](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/14/apple-is-only-the-latest-casualty-of-the-sino-american-tech-war) suffered last year as high inflation eroded consumer purchasing power and China’s economy recovered slower than expected.

**Belgian** authorities said they seized a record 116 tonnes of [cocaine](https://www.economist.com/films/2022/11/03/why-do-cocaine-traffickers-like-belgium) at the port of Antwerp in 2023, 5% more than in the previous year. The country has become Europe’s cocaine-trafficking capital, with Antwerp port a key entry point for drugs from South America. In the neighbouring **Netherlands** customs intercepted 60 tonnes of cocaine, up from 51 tonnes in 2022.

**Figure of the day:** 

40%, the share of Chinese people who say they are “afraid of the consequences” of protesting against the state. [Read the full story here.](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/01/16/chinas-leaders-are-less-popular-than-they-might-think)

### East Africa’s growing tensions

Geopolitics in the Horn of Africa is already off to a combustible start in 2024. Tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia are running high. The former’s [bid for a naval base](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/02/ethiopias-gambit-for-a-port-is-unsettling-a-volatile-region) on the coast of Somaliland, an internationally unrecognised breakaway state, has provoked an outcry. Meanwhile, fears are mounting that, nine months into its [catastrophic civil war](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/16/a-genocidal-militia-is-winning-the-war-in-sudan), Sudan’s most infamous warlord, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (better known as Hemedti), is edging [close to outright victory](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/20/a-supposed-haven-in-sudan-falls-to-a-genocidal-militia) over the national army.

African leaders are hoping nerves will be calmed by an extraordinary summit in Uganda on Thursday of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an east African bloc. But complications abound. IGAD wants to mediate a ceasefire between the armed factions in Sudan, and has invited Mr Dagalo to talks. But Sudan’s de facto president, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is refusing to attend, in protest at Mr Dagalo being treated as his equal. That puts the chances of a breakthrough even closer to zero.

### TSMC hopes for a chip-market boom

On Thursday TSMC, the world’s largest [chipmaker](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/04/05/tsmc-is-about-to-become-the-worlds-most-advanced-chipmaker), reports fourth-quarter results. The Taiwanese company’s profits look set to decline for the third quarter in a row, but with revenues increasing slightly over the same period in 2022, to NT$626bn ($20bn). The chipmaker is coping with weak demand in the smartphone market, where sales have been declining globally for several years.

Demand is growing for chips designed to train and run artificial-intelligence software. But AI chips sell in much lower volumes than those designed for smartphones, which have been TSMC’s mainstay for over a decade. The market for chips is cyclical, driven by the length of time it takes to expand manufacturing capacity to meet demand. World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, an industry body, forecasts that the bust in the overall chip market will turn to a boom in 2024, with sales growing by 13%. [TSMC ](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/19/tsmc-is-making-the-best-of-a-bad-geopolitical-situation)will be hoping to benefit.

### Spain’s strong recovery

Trade-balance figures due on Thursday will say more about Spain’s neighbours than about the country itself. [Spain](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/11/01/what-to-read-and-watch-to-understand-contemporary-spain) runs a trade deficit pretty much constantly. When its biggest trade partners—France, Germany and Italy—are sluggish, that deficit expands. That expansion is even greater when Spanish demand is stronger.

Such is the case now. Spain has [recovered strongly](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/26/spains-economy-is-recovering-from-the-pandemic-but-problems-persist) from a terrible pandemic (both epidemiologically and economically). Last year’s GDP growth was around 2.4%. The EU forecasts that this year’s will be just 1.7%, but that is still well ahead of its predictions for those big European partners. Among the bloc’s five biggest countries by population, only Poland is expected to do better. Inflation last year was also almost half the EU’s overall, though it is expected to approach average levels in 2024. In a country constantly evaluating its heft against that of its neighbours, even selling a bit less to them might be construed as good news.

### The Democratic National Convention’s return to Chicago

Around 500 representatives of the international media are visiting the United Centre in Chicago on Thursday to prepare for the Democratic National Convention, due to take place there in August. The party has not held its convention in the [Windy City](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/07/14/what-to-read-to-understand-chicago) since 1996. But in the preceding 150 or so years, Chicago hosted more nominating events for both of America’s main parties than anywhere else.

Most infamous was the Democratic convention of 1968, when Richard J. Daley, Chicago’s imperious mayor, campaigned hard to ensure that the party came to him. The event was held at the International Amphitheatre, in the heart of Daley’s home turf, but was overshadowed by the police’s brutality against Vietnam-war protesters. This time it is the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, who has brought the convention to the Prairie State. He will be hoping for lots of attention for his home city—though not of the sort of 1968.

### Ones to watch at the Sundance Film Festival

America’s coolest film festival begins on Thursday in Park City and Salt Lake City, both in Utah. Robert Redford, an American actor-director, helped to found the festival; it is named after his character in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid”, a classic western from 1969. It was set up to champion independent cinema, but has become known for showcasing contenders for the Academy Awards: “CODA”, the winner of an Oscar for best picture in [2022](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/03/28/have-the-oscars-lost-their-way), for instance, premiered at Sundance in 2021.

The line-up at the festival’s 40th edition includes “Love Lies Bleeding”, a romantic crime thriller with Kristen Stewart as a gym manager and Katy O’Brian as a bodybuilder; “Presence”, a haunted-house chiller directed by [Steven Soderbergh](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2018/03/02/unsane-is-a-ludicrous-low-budget-treat); and “The Outrun”, which stars Saoirse Ronan as an alcoholic who recuperates on the Orkney Islands. These films are not in contention for the Oscars in 2024, which take place in March. But they will be hoping for success in 2025.
