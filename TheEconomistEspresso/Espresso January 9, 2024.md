Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

An **Israeli** strike in southern Lebanon killed a senior commander in **Hizbullah**, an Iran-backed militant group. The strike was carried out after America’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned that conflict in the **Middle East** “could easily metastasise” as he began a five-day trip to the region. He will visit Saudi Arabia on Monday before travelling to Israel, where he is expected to urge officials to increase their efforts to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza. [Binyamin Netanyahu](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/03/binyamin-netanyahu-is-botching-the-war-time-to-sack-him), Israel’s prime minister, vowed to keep fighting until Hamas is eliminated.

**United Airlines** said it found loose bolts on several **Boeing** 737 Max 9 aircraft, the same type of plane that shed a door during an Alaska Airlines flight on Friday. America’s regulators grounded the model after the accident. Shares in Boeing fell by 8% on Monday, and the share price of Spirit AeroSystems, a major [Boeing](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/12/18/boeings-misplaced-strategy-on-the-737-max) supplier, was also down.

**Somalia’s** president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, warned **Ethiopia** against striking a deal with [Somaliland](https://www.economist.com/films/2024/01/05/why-ethiopias-port-deal-with-somaliland-fuels-tensions), a breakaway region in Somalia, over access to the Red Sea. The agreement would see Ethiopia offer shares in state-owned Ethiopian Airlines to Somaliland in exchange for a corridor through the territory to the coast. Mr Mohamud said he would “take all necessary measures” to defend “Somali territory”.

**Élisabeth Borne** resigned as **France’s** prime minister. Known as an efficient technocrat, [Ms Borne](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/05/17/meet-elisabeth-borne-frances-new-prime-minister) was the second woman to hold the post. [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/france-will-unify-for-sport-but-not-for-politics)—the president who, like Ms Borne, has low approval ratings—is expected to reshuffle his cabinet, seeking to bolster his centrist party against a resurgent far-right. Gabriel Attal, the 34-year-old education minister, is reportedly favoured to replace her.

**Johnson & Johnson**, a pharmaceuticals giant, announced it would spend $2bn to buy **Ambrx Biopharma**, a biotech company which has developed innovative new cancer therapies. Known as antibody drug conjugates, the treatments have sparked a flurry of dealmaking by other pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer and AbbVie. Shares in Ambrx surged in early trading on Monday.

**Russia** hit **Ukraine** with a [huge barrage](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/29/russia-tries-to-overwhelm-ukraine-with-missiles) of missiles and drones, continuing its strategy of targeting the country’s [energy infrastructure](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/02/ukraine-prepares-for-winter-again-as-russia-targets-its-power-grid) for the second winter in a row. The airstrikes killed four civilians and left 15,000 people without power during a bout of freezing weather. Meanwhile Ukrainian strikes on Russia caused authorities to evacuate around 300 people from the border city of Belgorod.

**Franz Beckenbauer**, regarded as one of the best footballers of all time, died aged 78. Known by the nickname “Der Kaiser”, the German led West Germany to victory at two World Cups in 1974 and 1990, first as captain and then as manager–one of only three people to manage the feat. He was credited with having invented the new role of sweeper, playing just in front of the defence.

### Blinken’s never-ending Middle East diplomacy

Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, will arrive in Israel on Tuesday—his fourth visit since October. During a week-long regional tour he is attempting to keep the war between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, from turning into a bigger regional conflagration. During a stop in Qatar he warned that the conflict “could easily metastasise”. It arguably already has.

On Monday an Israeli air strike in southern Lebanon killed a commander of the Radwan force, an elite commando unit of the militant group Hizbullah. It came just days after an apparent Israeli drone strike in Beirut killed Saleh al-Arouri, one of Hamas’s top leaders. As Israel begins to withdraw some troops from a [devastated Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/14/israels-current-large-scale-operation-is-the-last-one-in-gaza), the strikes in Lebanon are fuelling fears that it will shift focus and expand the fighting on its northern front. Until now, it has been cautious about that. But American officials are increasingly worried that Binyamin Netanyahu’s prudence will not last.

### Trump’s immunity claim in court

On Tuesday Donald Trump’s lawyers will try to persuade a court in Washington, DC, to toss out the former president’s election-stealing lawsuit. Ex-presidents cannot be sued in civil court for actions they undertook in office related to their official duties. Mr Trump wants this “absolute immunity” extended to the criminal realm. Without such broad protection, Mr Trump’s lawyers insist, “politically motivated prosecutions” will haunt future presidents. The prosecutor, Jack Smith, counters that overturning election results was far from an official duty.

Mr Smith knew that the challenge was coming. In December he asked the Supreme Court to [bypass](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/12/the-supreme-court-will-decide-how-quickly-donald-trump-is-prosecuted) the normal appeals process and take it up directly. His request was declined, but the matter will likely land back in the justices’ lap within weeks. The trial, scheduled to begin on March 4th, is [one of five](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/06/a-primer-on-trumps-criminal-trials) Mr Trump is due to face in 2024. Any delays could prevent voters from learning the verdicts before election day.

### Bullet-proof energy markets

America’s Energy Information Administration releases its twice-yearly forecast on energy markets on Tuesday. The prospects seem bleak. In the Red Sea America is weighing an offensive against the Houthis, a Yemeni militant group that routinely attacks ships in a conduit that carries 8-10% of the world’s seaborne oil and gas. Growing tension in the Middle East threatens to draw Gulf states into Israel’s war against Hamas. Meanwhile Russia continues to pound Ukraine, suggesting no end to the Western sanctions that are starting to cripple its gas projects. Any escalation in the Black Sea could hamper more oil shipments, too.

But the EIA will probably stay calm. After years of high prices, oil producers outside the Gulf have cranked up output, and the market is in [surplus](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/04/three-surprises-that-could-inflame-commodity-markets-in-2024). Europe is flush with gas, partly because of stockpiling. And demand for both oil and gas looks likely to remain subdued. It will take a lot to truly disrupt energy markets in 2024.

### Mexico’s economic outlook favours the ruling party

Official data due on Tuesday is likely to show that Mexico finished 2023 with annual inflation at around 4.5% (and 5.2% for “core” inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices). December will probably have been the second consecutive month in which inflation rose, having fallen since the third quarter of 2022. The central bank now does not expect to hit its target of 3% until 2025. Despite that, Mexico’s historically lacklustre economy is doing fairly well: GDP growth in 2023 is projected to have exceeded 3%.

Consumption is strong thanks to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador raising the minimum wage and increasing social handouts and public investment. Circumstances have been serendipitous, too. Many companies are looking to Mexico to avoid tensions between China and America. That said, investors are deterred by Mr López Obrador’s capriciousness. [Claudia Sheinbaum](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/mexico-will-elect-its-first-female-president)—the former Mexico City mayor expected to win June’s presidential election, also from the ruling party—may prove more business-friendly.

### New tech unveiled in Las Vegas

On Tuesday up to 130,000 people will descend on Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronic Show. The annual tech fair will attract representatives from three-fifths of the Fortune Global 500’s companies, as some 4,000 exhibitors display their newest devices, from games consoles to laptops. Over time the shindig has focused increasingly on cars and mobility. This year Honda, a Japanese carmaker, will show off its foldable electric scooter, and the event will also feature a race among [self-driving cars](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/self-driving-cars-are-slowly-moving-forward). Expect plenty of companies to talk up new artificial-intelligence features, too. Microsoft will show off its new keyboard button, which calls up Copilot, its AI assistant.

Behind the scenes, though, consumer tech is struggling amid fears of a looming economic slowdown. Smartphone sales are thought to have fallen by 3.5% in 2023, with shipments of televisions and laptops faring even worse. Exhibitors will be hoping that 2024 brings more joy.
