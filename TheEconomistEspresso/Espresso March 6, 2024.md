Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

The **European Commission** announced a [new defence strategy](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/02/18/can-europe-defend-itself-without-america) designed to boost the continent’s arms manufacturing sector. The plan asks that national governments spend half of their [defence procurement budgets](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/22/europe-faces-a-painful-adjustment-to-higher-defence-spending) within the bloc; it also stipulates that 40% of military equipment should be acquired in a “collaborative manner” by 2030. Aspects of the deal are contentious. Although it does not include a previous plan to establish a €100bn fund for defence, some fiscally-conservative states are sceptical of issuing common debt to support the strategy.

**Ukrainian** special forces sank the *Sergei Kotov*, a Russian warship worth $65m, according to Ukraine’s military-intelligence agency. The ship was targeted near the [Kerch Strait](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/28/russia-is-losing-the-battle-for-the-black-sea) using domestically manufactured Magura V5 [naval drones](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/12/07/ukrainian-ingenuity-is-ushering-in-a-new-form-of-warfare-at-sea), which Ukraine used to sink the *Caesar Kunikov*, another Russian warship, in February. Ukraine also claimed responsibility for striking an oil depot in Dolgoye, a village in Russia’s Belgorod region.

The price of **gold** rallied to over $2,141 per ounce, a record high, before falling again. The previous record, set last year, was around $2,135. Central banks have consistently been buying the [precious metal](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/13/the-mystery-of-gold-prices), which has buoyed its price. Investors in China have also flocked to gold as a hedge against the country’s [volatile stock market](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/07/chinas-stockmarket-nightmare-is-nowhere-near-over).

**iPhone** sales in **China** dropped by 24% on the previous year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to Counterpoint, a market-research firm. The device’s maker, Apple, is under pressure from Huawei, a Chinese firm which is now the American tech company’s [main rival](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/14/apple-is-only-the-latest-casualty-of-the-sino-american-tech-war) in China’s smartphone market. Huawei sales rose by 64% in the same period.

A far-left organisation called the Volcano Group claimed responsibility for a suspected **arson** attack on [Tesla’s factory in Germany](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/18/teslas-surprising-new-route-to-ev-domination). They said they targeted the plant because it “eats up earth, resources, people [and] labour”. Production has been stopped until at least next week. Elon Musk, **Tesla’s** CEO, used a German phrase to describe attacking electric vehicles for environmental reasons: *extrem dumm*.

**China** agreed to provide military support to the **Maldives** and promised to develop a “comprehensive” strategic partnership. The deal was signed by Mohamed Muizzu, who was elected president of the island nation last year after promising to draw closer to China and [push back against India](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/01/11/india-bridles-at-chinas-growing-presence-in-south-asia). In January he asked the small number of Indian troops stationed in the country to leave by mid-March.

**Russia** revealed that it is “seriously considering” working with **China** to build a nuclear power plant on the [moon](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/02/15/a-private-moon-mission-hopes-to-succeed-where-others-have-failed) by 2035. Yuri Borisov, the director of Roscosmos, said that Russia’s space agency is pursuing a project, first announced in 2021, which would include a scientific base and a fleet of lunar rovers. Mr Borisov said the plant would need to be built by robots.

***Correction:** Yesterday we mistakenly wrote that members of OPEC would extend cuts in oil production to avoid a surplus amid concerns about global economic growth. In fact, members of the broader OPEC+ will do so. Sorry.*

### Australia’s economic slowdown

A lucky country, Australia scrapes through most economic crises. But data released on Wednesday are expected to show its economy only narrowly avoided a contraction. Economists estimate that the country’s GDP grew by about 0.2% or less in the final quarter of 2023, as Australians struggling with high borrowing costs and inflation curbed their spending. On a per person basis, output is falling and the economy is in recession.

Only a record-breaking influx of immigrants is saving it from a technical crunch. More than 700,000 flocked down under in the year to June 2023. Net migration, a measure of immigrants minus emigrants, is more than double pre-pandemic levels. But not all Aussies are rolling out the red carpet. The influx has coincided with a housing crisis, which immigrants [are being blamed for](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/02/08/australias-enthusiasm-for-immigration-is-being-tested). Many grumble that a growing pie does not mean much when their slice of it is shrinking.

### Britain’s pre-election budget

Jeremy Hunt, Britain’s chancellor, announces his [budget](https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/02/22/a-memo-to-britains-chancellor-jeremy-hunt) on Wednesday. It may be the final [fiscal event](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2024/03/04/a-former-adviser-on-the-250-words-jeremy-hunt-should-read-out-at-the-budget) before the general election. The Conservative government is [polling 20 points behind](https://www.economist.com/interactive/uk-general-election/polls) the opposition Labour Party. Expect Mr Hunt to be generous. He will probably announce cuts to income or payroll tax; he is all but certain to continue a freeze on fuel duty. The chancellor is reportedly also considering a “British ISA” (a tax break for investors in British business). To help fund cuts, he may announce a reform of the “non-dom” tax shelter for well-off foreigners.

But Mr Hunt may be constrained by low “fiscal headroom”—the amount of extra spending or tax cutting that governments can undertake without breaking their own fiscal rules, in this case ensuring that the debt-to-GDP ratio falls in five years. A recent uptick in bond yields means that headroom has probably not moved much since November. Concern about inflation may also prevent a pre-election spending spree.

### The EU cracks down on tech giants

Wednesday marks the last day before the European Union’s landmark Digital Market Act comes into full force. It targets digital “gatekeepers”—tech companies with a market capitalisation of more than €75bn ($82bn) and more than 45m monthly active users in the EU. They include Alphabet and Apple. They will have to comply with obligations that [limit their market power](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/21/why-the-eu-will-not-remain-the-worlds-digital-uber-regulator). Under the DMA their platforms may not give preference to their own services and they must allow users to transfer their data to competing services. Fines will be steep: up to 10% of worldwide revenues.

The big question is whether the European Commission, the EU’s executive body, will have enough resources to enforce the DMA. This week the commission made it clear that it would seek to do so rigorously. On March 4th it fined Apple—the company that is likely to challenge the DMA most strongly, either in court or by seeking workarounds—more than €1.8bn for stifling competition from rival music-streaming services.

### Colombia’s opposition mobilises

By now [Gustavo Petro](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/01/25/colombias-first-avowedly-left-wing-president-is-mired-in-scandal), Colombia’s left-wing president, must have a thick skin. Opposition politicians have lambasted him as the “destroyer” of the country. More insults will fly on Wednesday when marches organised by right-wing parties take place in 15 cities. The protests are aimed at two of his most controversial policies.

Mr Petro is seeking to expand the state’s role in health care. His plan involves reforming the current insurance model, which covers 97% of Colombians, increasing primary care and establishing a new funding model for health providers. Mr Petro has also promised to overhaul the pension system to reduce income inequality. Critics argue that the reforms could hurt the country’s fragile public finances and labour market.

Colombians are also worried about a perceived rise in crime. A spate of armed robberies and murders has recently rattled Bogotá, the capital. The country has eight of the world’s 50 most dangerous cities. Many blame Mr Petro’s faltering negotiations with gangs and armed groups.

### AI divides and conquers prostate cancer

Diagnosing prostate cancer is easy. [Perhaps too easy](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2014/03/08/help-or-harm). If a blood test finds that you have high levels of a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA), you will probably be sent down a pathway that terminates in surgery. But PSA levels provide imperfect information—they can be high in healthy men. And in many cases the cancer remains harmless. Meanwhile, aggressive treatment can make men incontinent and impotent.


But artificial intelligence has brought some clarity. As recently reported in *Cell Genomics*, a journal, a trained neural network was fed genomic data from the prostate tumours of 159 men. The AI’s conclusion was startling: prostate cancer comes in two quite different varieties. Most tumours are of the relatively benign “canonical” variety. It is genetically distinct from the more aggressive “alternative” cancer. Men with the latter strain have worse prognoses. By figuring out which patients have which sort of cancer, the AI can help identify who really needs treatment.
