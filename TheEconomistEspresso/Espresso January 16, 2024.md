Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Iowans** faced arctic temperatures on Monday as they prepared to [caucus](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/10/donald-trumps-iowa-operation-suggests-his-campaign-will-be-formidable) for their preferred Republican presidential candidate. Donald Trump lashed out on social media at rivals Nikki Haley (“Globalist”), Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy (“Vivek Votes are wasted”). The former president is the first choice of nearly half of probable Republican caucus-goers, according to polls.

A delegation of **American** former officials met [William Lai Ching-te](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/01/13/defying-china-taiwan-elects-william-lai-ching-te-as-president), the president-elect of Taiwan, and Tsai Ing-wen, the current president. Mr Lai expressed his desire to deepen relations with America. The visit came as **Nauru**, a small Pacific island nation, cut diplomatic ties with **Taiwan** after the election. Taiwan’s deputy foreign minister accused China of trying to “seize Taiwan’s diplomatic relations” by poaching Nauru.

**America** said a Houthi missile struck an American-owned cargo ship off the south coast of Yemen. Nobody was injured. Earlier on Monday America shot down a missile directed at a Navy vessel by **Houthi** rebels. Last week America [launched air strikes](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/12/the-houthis-have-survived-worse-than-americas-and-britains-strikes) on the Iran-backed militant group in Yemen. Rishi Sunak, Britain’s prime minister, said that 13 Houthi military targets were destroyed in the strikes.

Around 10,000 farmers parked [trucks and tractors](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/11/german-farmers-and-train-drivers-are-scaring-germanys-bosses) in one of Berlin’s central avenues to protest against taxes. The demonstration was set off by the government’s decision to end subsidies for fuel used in agriculture and to cut an exemption from car tax for farm vehicles. Christian Lindner, **Germany’s** finance minister, told farmers at the protest that the government “can’t promise” more “state aid”.

**Lloyd Austin**, America’s defence secretary, was released from hospital after suffering complications from prostate-cancer surgery. For days he did not disclose his stay in an intensive care unit, which lasted from January 1st through 5th, to the White House or to his staff, [sparking controversy](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/08/joe-bidens-disappearing-defence-secretary) and spurring the Pentagon to review its notification policies.

**Boeing** said it will add further quality inspections for its 737 MAX 9s after a plane [shed a door](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/09/faulty-door-plugs-open-old-wounds-at-boeing) during an Alaska Airlines flight earlier this month. An outside party will be brought in to assess its production practices. The announcement comes after America’s Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday that all 737 MAX 9s should remain grounded until Boeing provides further information.

**Industrial production** in the euro zone fell by 0.3% month on month in November—the third consecutive decrease. Output was down by 6.8% from a year earlier. The slump was largely driven by contractions in **Germany** and **Italy**. The [eurozone economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/12/europes-economy-is-in-a-bad-way-policymakers-need-to-react) is in trouble: a shrinking manufacturing sector and sluggish services growth indicate that it fell into recession during the fourth quarter of 2023.

### How to tackle the Houthis

On Tuesday the United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold meetings on the Middle East—and Yemen in particular. The country has attracted renewed attention as the [Houthis](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/12/who-are-the-houthis-the-group-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea), a Iran-backed militant group based there, continue to attack vessels on the Red Sea, throttling a crucial commercial shipping route. Late last week America and Britain struck dozens of targets in Yemen to try to stop such attacks. On Monday America said the Houthis struck an American-owned cargo vessel, though it was able to continue its journey.

The group has [accrued an array](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/12/the-houthis-have-survived-worse-than-americas-and-britains-strikes) of anti-ship missiles over the last decade, many of them supplied by Iran. Although the Western strikes appear not to have destroyed that arsenal, merely making a significant dent in the stockpile could force the group to ration their munitions. That would make it easier for Western warships to defend vessels in the Red Sea—and alleviate some of the pressure on commercial shipping.

### Another defamation trial for Donald Trump

Donald Trump knows the cost of being found liable for defamation. Last year a jury in New York [sided with E. Jean Carroll](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/10/a-jury-unanimously-finds-donald-trump-liable-for-sexual-assault), a writer, who alleged that the former president defamed her by calling her a liar in 2022, after she publicly accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s. The verdict in that trial cost him $5m. On Tuesday another trial begins that will mainly focus on similar comments Mr Trump made about Ms Carroll in 2019, while he was still in office. Ms Carroll wants $10m plus an undisclosed, possibly much larger amount in punitive damages.

The judge has made clear that this trial will not be a “do over” of the first: the sexual assault is an established fact, he contends. The jury will assess how much Mr Trump has to pay in damages owing to the comments. Mr Trump has said he might testify in court. After all, the witness stand is another opportunity to appeal to his political base.

### All quiet on Wall Street

[Goldman Sachs](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/01/26/how-goldman-sachs-went-from-apex-predator-to-wall-street-laggard) and Morgan Stanley, America’s biggest investment banks, will report fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Analysts expect fairly pedestrian numbers. At both banks revenues for trading are expected to be flat year over year. The outlook is no more exciting for investment-banking desks, as firms remain cautious about going public or doing deals. Trading and investment-banking results from peers such as Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, released on January 12th, were lacklustre.

On Morgan Stanley’s earnings call, at least, excitement might be more focused on who is doing the talking. Investors will get their first glimpse of Ted Pick in his new role as the bank’s boss. On January 1st he officially replaced [James Gorman](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/02/20/why-morgan-stanley-wants-to-buy-etrade), who transformed Morgan Stanley from an also-ran to the envy of Wall Street during his 14-year term. Mr Pick has large shoes to fill.

### Sunak faces Tory rebellion

This week British MPs will vote on [legislation](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/12/14/the-magical-thinking-behind-britains-rwanda-bill) to enable the government to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda. In November Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that a government scheme—to send people who arrive in Britain on small boats to the African country to have their claims heard—was unlawful because it would put at risk the safety of asylum-seekers. The new Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill declares that Rwanda is, in fact, a safe country. It also shuts down most routes for appeal.

The bill faces a gauntlet of amendments in the House of Commons, where the ruling Conservative Party is split on the matter. Right-wingers—who claim to have around 50 backers—want to amend the bill to make legal challenges to deportation even harder. Tory moderates say the bill already goes as far as they can allow. To avoid a [large rebellion](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/14/rishi-sunaks-strategic-genius) Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, will have to perform a tricky balancing act.

### Mushroom-based materials are springing up

In 2021 Hermès, a French fashion house, launched a handbag made from mushroom leather, in collaboration with MycoWorks, an American firm. But the handbag is no longer generally available, nor is any other [mushroom-leather accessory](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/06/fashion-gets-a-modern-makeover). The material, which is generally produced in cell-culturing vats, is expensive and perceived to be of lower quality than the real thing. MycoWorks’ products cost what exotic-animal hides do.

Japanese scientists have now developed a simpler way to extract the fabric-like material, called mycelium, from mushrooms. The researchers first applied hydrogen peroxide to inedible mushrooms and their residue. Next they bleached the mycelial pulp in sunlight, and finally exposed it to ultrasound. The resulting fibres are cheap, malleable and biodegradable—ideal for sponges and yarns. The researchers suggest that the new method could lead to the development of everyday mushroom-based products, including textiles and packaging. The uses of fungus are spreading beyond the manufacture of handbags.
