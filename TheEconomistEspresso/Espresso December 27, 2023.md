Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Russia’s defence ministry admitted that a Ukrainian strike on Feodosiya, a port city in eastern **Crimea**, had damaged one of its **warships**. One person was killed and two were injured, according to the Russian-installed governor of the occupied peninsula. The ship is thought to be the *Novocherkassk,* a large landing vessel. Ukraine’s air force claimed it had in fact destroyed the ship and likened its fate to that of the [*Moskva*](https://www.economist.com/interactive/1843/2023/07/27/how-ukraines-virtually-non-existent-navy-sank-russias-flagship), the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, which Ukrainian forces sank in April 2022.

Yoav Gallant, **Israel’s** defence minister, said that his country was in a “multi-front war” with attacks from “seven theatres”. They included not only Gaza, but also Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Syria, the West Bank and Yemen. His comments followed reports in Iran’s state media that an Israeli airstrike in Syria killed Seyed Razi Mousavi, a senior **Iranian** general. [Iran](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/05/the-gaza-war-has-deepened-joe-bidens-iran-nightmare) pledged to avenge the attack.

**Apple** failed to overturn a ban on the import and sale of two of its watches in America. The firm is accused of infringing the copyright of Masimo, a medical-technology company, with its Series 9 and Ultra 2 models. America’s International Trade Commission provisionally blocked imports of the watches in October. On Tuesday the Biden administration decided not to overturn the ban. Apple will appeal.

The share price of **Infosys** fell after the [Indian tech giant](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/07/24/can-foreign-venture-capitalists-make-good-money-from-indian-tech) said the plug had been pulled on an AI deal that it had negotiated with an unnamed firm. The agreement had been worth $1.5bn and was due to run for 15 years. Infosys’s chief financial officer, Nilanjan Roy, resigned two weeks ago. It is unclear whether the two events are related.

Militias killed at least 160 people in Plateau state in central **Nigeria** over the weekend. Agence France Presse reported that armed groups attacked around 20 villages in the state. Violence between nomads and farmers has flared in the region as competition for resources becomes fiercer.

**Alexei Navalny**, Russia’s most important opposition leader, delivered a message of defiance after his transportation to a penal colony in the Arctic, 1,900km north-east of Moscow. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) Mr Navalny described the 20-day journey as “pretty exhausting” but suggested he was “still in a good mood”. He [faces up to 30 years](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/14/alexei-navalny-russias-opposition-leader-is-missing-in-the-gulag) in prison on trumped-up charges.

### 2024 in preview: Modi’s expected re-election

*This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?*

Next spring, India will hold [a general election](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/narendra-modis-expected-re-election-will-inspire-fear-and-hope). Opinion polls suggest a victory for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. But the BJP, led by Narendra Modi, has struggled in richer southern states. It also faces a concerted challenge after 26 opposition parties, including Congress, formed a coalition.

Since Mr Modi became prime minister in 2014, India has grown from the world’s tenth-largest economy to its fifth. But opponents say Mr Modi muzzles critics and encourages discrimination against Muslims.

Western countries have been reluctant to criticise Mr Modi. America, in particular, sees India as a [counterbalance](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/20/what-the-china-india-detente-means-for-the-west) to China. But they are worried about his failure to protect democratic values. America and Canada both accuse India of plotting to assassinate Sikh separatists on their soil (in Canada’s case, Hardeep Singh Nijjar was indeed killed). Mr Modi promises that by 2047, the centenary of independence, India will be a developed country. The question is not just how developed it will be—but how democratic.

### 2024 in preview: Taiwan chooses a new president

*This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?*

On January 13th Taiwan will [elect a new president](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/china-is-watching-closely-who-will-be-taiwans-next-president). The stakes are high: the winner may have to determine the island’s strategy to [stop China invading](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/09/how-scary-is-china). The ruling, pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party favours strengthening relations with the West while building military deterrence. The opposition, pro-unification Kuomintang promises to reopen dialogue with China on the basis that they belong to one country.

Over eight years of DPP rule, China has increased its “grey-zone” activity, which falls short of warfare but probes Taiwan’s defences. If William Lai, the DPP’s candidate, wins, China may ramp up aggression. A KMT victory could reduce tensions in the short run. But China’s military build-up at home would continue—as would its determination to take Taiwan by force if it does not surrender peacefully.

Taiwan’s current president, Tsai Ing-wen of the DPP, has had a different message for her people: in order to prevent war, they must unite and prepare for it. The election will show whether they are ready to do so.

### 2024 in preview: China’s leaders will seek to exploit global divisions

*This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?*

Next year Xi Jinping, China’s leader, will seek to rally countries that are sceptical of an American-dominated world order. But he will also present China as a [defender of global unity](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/chinas-leaders-will-seek-to-exploit-global-divisions-in-2024). With global growth slowing, China’s government will charge rich Western countries with erecting protectionist barriers to free trade. It will also say it is a defender of the “basic principles” of the existing world order, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter—selective reading of which emphasises the inviolability of sovereign states.

This balancing act will be complicated by the war in Ukraine and the presidential election in America. China will claim neutrality over Ukraine, but blame high food and energy prices on Western sanctions. It will also deepen ties with Russia. Meanwhile the race for the White House presents dangers, as candidates vie to out-hawk one another on China. Mr Xi’s best hope is that American democracy looks terrible, but that China does not dominate headlines. Xi-era statecraft is not known for its subtlety; 2024 poses an exquisite test.

### 2024 in preview: Asia’s new energy networks

*This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?*

In 2024 burgeoning energy [linkages](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/the-energy-transition-could-create-unexpected-linkages-in-asia) could rewrite the way Asia deals with itself. Take the fast-growing economies of South-East Asia. Their energy demand is expected to increase by a third by 2050; they have also promised to cut carbon emissions. Yet doing that will be tricky, since renewables account for a mere 15% of Asia’s power generation.

A better-connected South-East Asian grid, currently non-existent, could slash clean-energy prices. Rolling one out could also foster co-operation. A series of interconnection agreements were signed in August at a regional summit in Bali, Indonesia.

Energy projects can also provide valuable counterweights to China. Australia has ambitions to be a renewable-energy hub. Japan and South Korea are interested in taking [hydrogen](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/03/can-a-viable-industry-emerge-from-the-hydrogen-shakeout) and ammonia (a way to store hydrogen in a more portable form). America’s allies are also trying to loosen China’s grip on rare earths and critical minerals. For now China is the biggest solar-panel exporter, electric-vehicle-battery supplier and critical-minerals processor. But the transition offers welcome new options for Asian countries to come out of China’s shadow.
