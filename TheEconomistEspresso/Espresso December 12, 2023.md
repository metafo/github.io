Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**The Israel Defence Forces** approached the eastern part of Khan Younis, a city in the south of the Gaza Strip. It advised hundreds of thousands of people in the city to move towards al-Mawasi, a small coastal town. Earlier **Hamas** said that **Israel** would not receive its “prisoners alive” unless it agrees to “an exchange and negotiation”. But Qatar’s prime minister said that the possibility of securing [a new ceasefire](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/10/israel-has-just-a-few-weeks-left-to-destroy-hamas) is diminishing. More than 18,000 people in Gaza have been killed since October 7th, according to the enclave’s Hamas-run health ministry.

The **UN** climate body published a draft agreement setting out ways that countries “could” limit their consumption of fossil fuels by 2050. But it omitted reference to “phasing out” use of all fossil fuels, angering attendees at [COP28](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/16/three-climate-fights-will-dominate-cop28). **America’s** state department said the language must be “substantially strengthened”; the **EU’s** lead negotiator said parts of the document were “fully unacceptable”.

Allies of **Alexei Navalny**, a Russian opposition politician, said his whereabouts are unknown after he missed a court appearance on Monday. Mr Navalny, who is serving a [19-year jail sentence](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/04/alexei-navalnys-jailers-are-tightening-the-screws), has not been in contact with his aides since last week, sparking concerns that he may have been moved to a “special regime” prison, the harshest kind in the Russian system. Mr Navalny is known to be in poor health.

**Jack Smith**, the special counsel trying **Donald Trump** for [election interference](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/06/a-primer-on-trumps-criminal-trials), asked the **Supreme Court** to rule on Mr Trump’s claim that he is immune from prosecution for crimes allegedly committed in office. It was earlier dismissed by a lower court. Mr Smith’s unusual intervention reflects his concern that if Mr Trump’s appeal goes through normal channels, his trial, slated to start in March, could be delayed.

The **UN** ended its decade-long peacekeeping mission in **Mali**. The 13,000-strong force [struggled](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/02/03/why-un-forces-are-finding-it-hard-to-bring-peace-to-mali) in the West African country, which has been plagued by widespread Islamist violence and is ruled by a military junta. Over the summer the junta asked the UN mission to leave, saying it had [failed to stop](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/its-going-to-get-grimmer-in-the-sahel) the jihadists. A French force left last year, also at the junta’s urging.

A report by the **UN** said that the value of **global trade** will slump by around 5% year-on-year in 2023, down from a record high of $32.2trn last year. The document cited an 8% decline in merchandise trade as the main cause of the contraction, and warned that [the future of global trade](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/10/02/governments-across-the-world-are-discovering-homeland-economics) is “highly uncertain”.

Shares in **Macy’s** rose 16% in pre-market trading after the *Wall Street Journal* reported that the department store had received a $5.8bn buyout offer. Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, a pair of existing investors, reportedly submitted a proposal to acquire the remaining stock for $21 per share on December 1st. Macy’s reported better-than-expected quarterly profit in November, after a pandemic-induced [slump](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/05/07/ode-to-the-shopping-mall).

### Zelensky in Washington

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, visits Washington, DC on Tuesday, seeking to shake the West out of its war fatigue. He will meet President Joe Biden, Senate leaders and the speaker of the House of Representatives. Mr Zelensky is fresh from a visit to Argentina, where he attended the inauguration of its president, Javier Milei. There, Mr Zelensky had a “frank” conversation with Viktor Orban, Hungary’s leader, to urge him not to block the EU from giving more aid to Ukraine and starting accession negotiations with the country.

Mr Biden is hoping that Mr Zelensky’s charisma will help secure [agreement in Congress](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/27/ukraines-new-enemy-war-fatigue-in-the-west) to renew assistance to Ukraine (now wrapped up with funding for Israel and Taiwan). But divided Republicans say Ukraine aid depends on tougher asylum policies to stem the flow of migrants across America’s southern border.

Just a year ago Congress gave Mr Zelensky a standing ovation. Now [Western arms supplies are drying up](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/12/07/the-senate-blocked-aid-for-ukraine-now-what). Ukraine will struggle to defend itself without American and European support.

### University presidents in trouble

One week on from a congressional hearing on antisemitism, some of America’s elite universities are in turmoil. On December 5th three university presidents—from Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—were widely criticised for their performances. Penn’s president resigned over the weekend. On Monday local time the Harvard board will meet and, it seems, discuss their own president’s future.

The furor started when Elise Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman, asked them if calling for the genocide of Jews would violate the schools’ rules. “If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment,” said Liz Magill of Penn. Sally Kornbluth of MIT said it could, “if targeted at individuals”. It depends “on the context”, said Claudine Gay of Harvard.

“One down. Two to go,” said Ms Stefanik when Ms Magill stepped down. Faculty are rallying around Ms Gay, who has apologised for her waffling. The Harvard board’s meeting was long-scheduled, but Ms Gay’s future is reportedly a new addition to the agenda.

### America’s slowly slowing inflation

Inflation in America is [coming off the boil](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/13/is-americas-inflationary-fever-breaking). Figures released on Tuesday are expected to show that consumer prices were about 3% higher in November than a year earlier, bringing the inflation rate ever closer to the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. The annual rate has declined from a peak of 9% in mid-2022. That is fuelling expectations that the Fed has finished raising interest rates, and could even begin cutting them as soon as next spring.

Details of the latest data, however, may temper the optimism. Underlying price pressures may still be robust. Supply-chain bottlenecks drove up prices during the economy’s recovery from the covid pandemic. Those have now mostly unwound. The remaining excess inflation will be harder to root out, stemming from still-high wage costs and remarkable resilience in economic growth. The Fed may be wary of cutting rates before it is absolutely confident that it has vanquished inflation.

### Tough times for Sunak

Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, faces an important test of his premiership on Tuesday. The House of Commons will hold its first vote on the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill. In 2022 the government struck a deal to send migrants who arrive on Britain’s shores in [small boats](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/11/02/why-small-boats-are-a-big-problem-for-britain) to Rwanda, before their asylum claims could be heard. But last month Britain’s Supreme Court struck down the scheme. Judges declared there was a risk that claims would be wrongly processed and that asylum-seekers would be sent back to dangerous countries.

Mr Sunak’s new bill attempts to overcome that bar by declaring the African country legally safe and barring court challenges that contest the assertion. His Conservative Party is [badly split](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/12/07/the-british-conservatives-crisis-over-rwanda-is-a-rerun-of-brexit) over the proposals: Mr Sunak faces potential rebellions from both its right and centre. If he loses, his authority will be shattered. Yet the vote’s consequences could be even graver for those arriving in small boats.

### Football’s other World Cup

Which football club is the world’s best? Since 2000 FIFA, the game’s governing body, has run the annual Club World Cup to find out. The knock-out tournament comprises winners of regional competitions in Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and Oceania. The 2023 edition kicks off in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia’s second city, on Tuesday.

The tournament is beset by a structural problem: European clubs are much richer than their opponents, so tend to win. The European representative, the winner of the previous season’s Champions League, has won the past ten editions. (This year will probably follow the pattern, with Manchester City, European champions, beating their South American counterparts, Fluminense, in the final.)

Still, FIFA wants to cash in by expanding the event from the current seven teams to 32 in 2025 and shifting it to the summer. FIFPRO, the players’ union, long [critical of the number of matches](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/08/25/is-there-too-much-football) footballers have to play, is unimpressed.
