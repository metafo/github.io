## The world in brief

### November 24, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Qatar’s foreign ministry** said that the truce between Israel and Hamas will begin on Friday at 7am local time. Hamas are expected to release the first 13 hostages at 4pm. The release of 50 hostages is part of a deal that includes a four-day pause in Israel’s attack on Gaza. Under the agreement, Israel is expected to free around 150 Palestinian prisoners and to allow around 300 aid-bearing trucks to enter [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/19/what-happens-to-gaza-after-the-war) from Egypt each day. Meanwhile **Hamas** said that the director of **al-Shifa hospital** in Gaza has been detained by **Israel**, along with other medical staff. Israel claims that the hospital serves as a command centre for Hamas.

**Turkey’s central bank** raised interest rates by a larger-than-expected five percentage points, to 40%. The lira rallied on the news. The annual inflation rate is more than 60%. It is the sixth consecutive hike [since June](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/01/turkeys-bizarre-economic-experiment-enters-a-new-phase), when the policy rate was 8.5%. But the central bank indicated that the tightening would end soon.

Disorder broke out in **Dublin** following a knife attack outside a school that injured five people, including three children. A crowd of what Irish police called a “hooligan faction driven by far-right ideology” gathered and set fire to several vehicles. City-centre public transport was suspended. The police have arrested one of those injured in connection with the stabbings.

**Germany’s finance ministry** said that the “debt brake”—which limits annual federal net borrowing to no more than 0.35% of nominal GDP—would be suspended for 2023. The move comes after the [Federal Constitutional Court](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/15/german-judges-toss-a-spanner-into-the-governments-spending-plans) retroactively blocked a transfer of €60bn ($65bn) of funds originally earmarked for covid-19 to other purposes, causing a budget nightmare.

The **World Health Organisation** made an official request to **China** for information on an increase in reported clusters of pneumonia in children. Local reports suggest that hospitals in northern China are overwhelmed with cases. Chinese officials have attributed the spike in respiratory diseases to the lifting of stringent covid-19 measures. SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes [covid-19](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/02/will-we-ever-know-how-many-people-died-of-covid-19-in-china), was first discovered in China.

A letter from researchers to the [board](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/22/the-fallout-from-the-weirdness-at-openai) of **OpenAI**, warning about an **artificial general intelligence** project which could pose a **threat to humanity**, reportedly contributed to its decision to (briefly) sack Sam Altman, the chief executive. OpenAI was founded as a non-profit research lab aimed at safely developing AGI, which can equal or surpass humans in all types of thinking.

People in the small town of Livingston, **Kentucky**, had their Thanksgiving plans scuppered when a train derailed on Wednesday. The train carried molten sulphur which spilled and caused a fire that was still burning on Thursday morning. Livingston residents were asked to evacuate. The train company, CSX, said it would pay for their lodgings and a Thanksgiving dinner.

### Japan’s welcome inflation

On Friday Japan releases October’s inflation figures. The consumer-price index, which excludes fresh food, is expected to remain above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target for the 19th consecutive month; economists reckon on 3%. This inflationary trend began with higher prices for imports. But now prices for nearly 90% of items in the CPI basket are rising.

After decades of deflation or low inflation, that is [welcome](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/16/will-japan-rediscover-its-dynamism). The BoJ is even exploring strategies to exit its accommodative monetary policies. In recent months it tweaked the parameters of its yield curve control, which caps long-term bond yields. Analysts expect it will do away with negative interest rates next year.

Yet the BoJ will not [rush](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/16/is-japans-economy-at-a-turning-point) into tightening. After growing 4.8% year-on-year in the second quarter, GDP contracted by 2.1% in the third. Wage growth is the fastest for decades, but still trails price increases. Wage negotiations next spring will help determine whether inflation has finally become sustainable.

### Cathay flies out of a storm

China’s Communist Party does not exactly fly the flag for Hong Kong’s flag-carrier. Cathay Pacific, which on Friday will update investors on its business, went into the [party’s bad books](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/08/22/cathay-pacifics-fate-rattles-multinationals-in-hong-kong) in 2019 after staff vocally supported Hong Kong’s anti-government protests. Swire, Cathay’s British-empire-era parent company, struggles to convince the party of its fealty. When cabin crew were recorded this year ridiculing Mandarin-speaking mainland Chinese passengers for not speaking English or Cantonese (Hong Kong’s local dialect), state media pounced.

In turn, Cathay’s bosses have reason to (privately) seethe at the Hong Kong government. The territory’s lengthy isolation during the pandemic left the carrier on the brink, forcing the government to recapitalise it.

With Hong Kong open again, things are picking up. Cathay could reach 70% of pre-pandemic capacity this year. Half-year profits hit HK$4.27bn ($546m). The threat of a takeover by state-owned Air China has lessened. Now it must ensure its relationship with the party does not nosedive again.

### Somalia joins the EAC

The East African Community began as a trio of like-minded countries—Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda—nestled between Lake Victoria and the Indian Ocean. Now it is the most integrated regional bloc in Africa, based on measures such as trade, free movement and transport links. And soon it will stretch from the Atlantic to the Horn of Africa. At a meeting on Friday in Tanzania the EAC is expected to welcome [Somalia](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/12/19/somalia-is-on-the-brink-of-famine) as its eighth member.

Somalia should benefit from joining a bloc that is both a forum for diplomacy and a market for business. The EAC will gain more than 3,000km of coastline, which officials say will boost trade with the Arabian peninsula.

But the EAC faces [obstacles](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/02/09/a-political-union-for-east-africa). Its customs union is undermined by tariff deviations, which have increased over time, and its common market is still a work in progress. Somalia, meanwhile, is battling a long jihadist insurgency. Expanding the club is the easy part. Integration will take much longer.

### Germany’s ailing economy

Recent news about Germany’s economy has not been good. Friday’s publication of a monthly business-climate index by Ifo, an economic-research institute, is unlikely to lift the mood.

This week Germany’s central bank forecast that the economy will shrink in the fourth quarter—which would mean contraction in three quarters out of four. Politicians are also reeling from a ruling by Germany’s [top court](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/15/german-judges-toss-a-spanner-into-the-governments-spending-plans) that the government’s plan to spend €60bn ($65bn) earmarked for battling covid-19 on green projects instead was unconstitutional. To save the government's efforts to recalibrate the economy, next week Germany's finance minister will present a supplementary budget which may suspend the “debt brake”, a constitutional limit on government spending.

The Bundesbank believes next year’s prospects are more encouraging. It forecasts that demand for exports, notably machinery, should start to recover and expects strong wage growth and low unemployment. Nevertheless, it will take a while for Germany to regain its reputation as Europe’s economic engine.

### The ripening of wine tourism

Rioja has long attracted connoisseurs of the plum and vanilla-scented tipple it is famous for. On Friday a UN conference on vinitourism wraps up in Spain’s best-known wine region. Holidays to [discover](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/02/17/what-to-read-to-understand-wine)—and drink—wine are increasingly popular. [Vineyards](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/03/02/the-origin-of-grapevines-is-a-tangled-vine-itself), many of which are located on picturesque hillsides, compete by hosting tastings, pairing courses and “crush camps” in wine-making. Burgeoning wine regions, such as[ Sussex](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/19/the-rise-of-english-viticulture), in southern England, are linking vineyards together with cycle paths.

Future Market Insights, a research firm, forecasts that the wine tourism sector will grow 13% annually over the next decade. Producers welcome the extra revenue. Poor [weather](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/07/15/climate-change-is-affecting-wine-flavours) this year, including droughts and floods, means that wine production globally is at its lowest level in decades. Yields are down by 12% in Italy and by 14% in Spain. [France](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/08/04/how-provencal-rose-became-the-summer-tipple-par-excellence), where output has not fallen, will remain the world’s largest producer. But America is one of few countries popping corks: production there is expected to rise by 12% this year.
