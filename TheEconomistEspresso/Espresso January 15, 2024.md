## The world in brief

### January 15, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



China called on foreign governments who had congratulated **William Lai Ching-te** of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party on winning **Taiwan’s** presidential election, not to interfere in its “internal affairs”. America, Britain and Japan, and the European Union had all praised the result. In simultaneous legislative elections, the DPP lost its parliamentary majority. A Chinese spokesman said the election results showed the DPP “does not represent mainstream public opinion”, and that China remains set on “national unification”. Taiwan’s foreign ministry called on China to “face reality”.

Thousands of **Israelis**, including relatives of those still being held hostage by **Hamas** in [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/10/just-how-bad-is-it-in-gaza), gathered in Tel Aviv to mark the 100th day since [October 7th](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/07/israel-reels-as-hamas-launches-a-spectacular-and-bloody-offensive), when Hamas militants killed 1,200 Israelis. Around 130 hostages are still unaccounted for; 110 were [released](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/23/israel-strikes-a-hostage-deal-but-says-the-gaza-war-isnt-over) in November. A large pro-Israel rally was held in London following a pro-Palestinian event on Saturday.

After a meeting in Cairo, **China’s** foreign minister, Wang Yi, and **Egypt’s** president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, called for a ceasefire in Gaza and expressed concern over freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. America has launched air strikes against the Yemen-based Houthi rebels attacking cargo ships in the sea. Mr Wang pointed out that the UN Security Council had not approved such retaliation.

Ahead of the World Economic Forum’s gathering in **Davos** representatives from **Ukraine’s** government met national security advisors from more than 80 countries to discuss [Volodymyr Zelensky’s](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/01/a-new-years-interview-with-volodymr-zelensky) “peace formula” to end the war with Russia. More than 60 world leaders and thousands of business people will meet in the Swiss alpine resort from Monday. Mr Zelensky will address them later in the week.

Mohamed Muizzu, the president of the **Maldives**, set a deadline of March 15th for the withdrawal by **India** of all its 75 troops from the islands. The two countries’ historically close ties have been [strained](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/01/11/india-bridles-at-chinas-growing-presence-in-south-asia) since Mr Muizzu was elected in November on a platform of loosening the Maldives’ ties with India. He has just returned from China, which is competing with India for influence in the region.

**Donald Trump** is heading into the [Iowa caucuses](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/01/10/how-the-iowa-caucuses-are-changing-in-2024) as the first choice of 48% of probable Republican caucus goers, according to a poll from NBC News and the *Des Moines Register*. Nikki Haley is the favourite for 20% of them. Ms Haley overtook Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, who came second in December’s poll. [Mr Trump](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/16/donald-trump-poses-the-biggest-danger-to-the-world-in-2024) is the firm favourite to win the Republican presidential nomination.

Hundreds of firefighters battled **wildfires** burning to the north of Perth, the capital of **Western Australia**. More than 40 separate fires are burning across the vast state, which is experiencing a severe drought. The [El Niño](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/08/31/what-is-el-nino) weather system has caused unusually hot temperatures in parts of Australia, where it is the middle of summer, increasing the risk of fires.

### Iowa’s Republican caucuses

Donald Trump appears to be coasting toward the Republican Party’s nomination for [president](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/16/donald-trump-poses-the-biggest-danger-to-the-world-in-2024). But on Monday he will face his first real electoral test: the [Iowa caucuses](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/01/10/how-the-iowa-caucuses-are-changing-in-2024).

Mr Trump is the first choice of 48% of probable Republican caucus-goers, according to a poll from NBC News and the *Des Moines Register*. Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, and Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, trail by some 30 points as they battle for second place. Both remain longshots. But a strong showing in the Hawkeye State could provide momentum for future contests.

A bigger upset for Mr Trump could come from the weather. Sub-zero temperatures could affect turnout and the outcome of the caucuses, which require Iowans to attend lengthy in-person events rather than simply cast a ballot and go home. Democrats may have a more comfortable time. This year, for the first time ever, they will choose their candidate by mail.

### After 100 days the Gaza war staggers on

Thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv at the weekend to mark 100 days of war in Gaza—and to demand a deal that would free the roughly 130 hostages still held there, even if it stops the fighting. Around the world, meanwhile, thousands of people attended pro-Palestinian protests that called for a ceasefire to end a conflict which has killed at least 23,000 [Gazans](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/10/just-how-bad-is-it-in-gaza).

Yet no such deal seems imminent. Israeli troops are still combing northern Gaza for [tunnel shafts](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/11/israel-has-yet-to-destroy-even-half-of-gazas-tunnels) and searching the southern city of Khan Younis for Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza. The army chief urges “patience”.

Egypt, which has replaced Qatar as the main mediator between Israel and Hamas, is trying to broker an agreement to release the remaining hostages. Israel’s prime minister, [Binyamin Netanyahu](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/03/binyamin-netanyahu-is-botching-the-war-time-to-sack-him), may, one day, have to choose between securing their freedom and continuing to fight Hamas—the war’s two irreconcilable aims. For now, though, that war grinds on.

### The World Economic Forum in Davos

Political and business leaders from around the world descend on the Swiss alpine resort of [Davos](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/05/26/is-this-the-end-of-davos-man) this week for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. More than 60 heads of state and government are expected to attend, including Li Qiang, China’s premier, and [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/01/a-new-years-interview-with-volodymr-zelensky), the president of Ukraine, who will address the conference and is promoting his plan to end the war in his country. They will rub shoulders with more than 1,000 company bosses and financiers.

Topics of debate are likely to range from the threat of escalation in the [Middle East](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/29/the-year-everything-and-nothing-changed-in-the-middle-east) and the consequences of disruption in the Red Sea for global supply chains, to the economic potential of generative artificial intelligence. But in 2024, which is the [biggest election year](https://www.economist.com/interactive/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/2024-is-the-biggest-election-year-in-history) in history, bosses will be keen to understand what political changes could mean for their business. Expect America’s presidential election, and the possible return of [Donald Trump](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/an-unpopularity-contest-between-joe-biden-and-donald-trump-looms), to feature especially prominently.

### An unhappy new year for German business

On Monday Germany’s statistics agency will release figures for last year’s GDP. The government expects that Europe’s biggest economy will have shrunk in 2023 by around 0.4%—making it the only big economy to contract. Last year ended with an unexpected drop in business confidence. The outlook for 2024 is hardly rosier.

Germany is facing headwinds including a [budgetary crisis](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/12/14/german-business-is-fed-up-with-a-government-in-disarray), high interest rates and high energy prices. Several prominent economists predict another year of contraction. Businesses are struggling. Last week Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof, a chain of department stores, became the first high-profile collapse of the year.

In a country admired for its stability, labour relations are unusually fraught too. Train drivers have walked out and doctors are threatening to. A demonstration in Berlin on Monday will mark the end of a week of action by [farmers](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/11/german-farmers-and-train-drivers-are-scaring-germanys-bosses), who blocked roads with their green tractors. Despite the government agreeing to their demands over fuel subsidies the *Mistgabelmop* (“pitchfork mob”) have pledged to keep up the disruption.

### A delayed Emmy awards

After a troubled year in Hollywood, stars and executives will be relieved that the awards season is now under way. A week after the Golden Globes, the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards will take place in Los Angeles on Monday night. Hosted by Anthony Anderson, the star of “Black-ish”, a sitcom, the Emmys celebrate the best American television aired between June 2022 and May 2023. Traditionally held in September, the Emmys ceremony was postponed because of the Hollywood strikes, which saw around 11,500 writers and 160,000 actors down tools for months last year. It is the first time the Emmys have been delayed since 2001, when they were disrupted by the attacks of 9/11.

“The Last of Us”, “The White Lotus” and “Ted Lasso” have all been nominated in multiple categories. But [“Succession”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/02/what-happens-when-a-story-loses-a-main-character), a business saga, and “The Bear”, a dark comedy about a troubled chef, are tipped to do well—both swept the floor at the Golden Globes.
