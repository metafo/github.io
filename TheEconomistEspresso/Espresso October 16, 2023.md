Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

As Binyamin Netanyahu, **Israel’s** prime minister, vowed to “demolish [Hamas](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-atrocities-and-israels-retaliation-will-change-both-sides-for-ever)” ahead of an offensive in the Gaza Strip, American officials warned that the conflict could spread across the Middle East. Israel told people in Gaza to evacuate south towards Egypt. Gazan officials say that more than 2,400 people have been killed, mainly by Israeli air strikes. Some of them were [trying to flee](https://www.economist.com/is-israel-acting-within-the-laws-of-war-in-gaza). Egypt, meanwhile, has positioned troops near the border, saying that any attempt to push refugees into the country would violate its security and international law. Iran’s foreign minister said that “the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger” if Israeli aggression continues.

**Hizbullah**, a **Lebanese** militant group, fired missiles over **Israel’s** northern border, killing one person and injuring three others. A spokesman for the Israeli armed forces said they were prepared to fight on a [second front](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/13/israel-faces-the-danger-of-fighting-on-a-second-front) there if necessary. Meanwhile, officials in Syria said that Israel bombed the main airports in Damascus and Aleppo. Both Hizbullah and the Syrian regime are backed by Iran.

Exit polls suggested that **Poland**’s ruling Law and Justice party lost the [country’s election](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/11/why-the-polish-election-campaign-has-been-so-vicious). The right-wing populist party apparently won the most votes—36.8%—but that does not look like enough to form a government. Donald Tusk, the opposition leader, claimed that his Civic Coalition could form a coalition with smaller parties. That would mean seismic change for Poland, which the PiS has governed since 2015.

Indigenous **Australian** leaders called for a week of silence after voters in a referendum overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to amend the constitution to establish a “[Voice to Parliament](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/05/what-is-australias-voice-to-parliament)”. The Voice was to be a group of indigenous leaders whom the government would consult on issues affecting their communities. It was “a bitter irony” that Australia’s First People remain unrecognised in the constitution, the leaders said.

The **IMF** said members had agreed on a “meaningful increase” to their contributions to the fund, to be implemented this year. The IMF will also grant a representative from sub-Saharan Africa a third seat on its executive board. The global lender is holding a week-long meeting in Morocco, its first in Africa since 1973.

Christopher Luxon, the leader of the **New Zealand** National Party, is set to form a government after his party won national elections, ending six years of Liberal rule. Chris Hipkins, the incumbent, has conceded. Mr Hipkins became prime minister in January after his predecessor, Jacinda Ardern, stepped down unexpectedly.

A **“ring of fire” eclipse**, caused by the moon partially blocking the light of the sun, became visible across parts of the **United States**, Mexico and Central America. Its full extent was only visible on a narrow strip of land running from Oregon to Texas. Some viewers’ hopes were dampened by poor weather.

### Fears of a second front in Israel

By Sunday evening Israel’s anticipated ground invasion of Gaza still had not begun, despite the increasingly bellicose statements of its government. Civilians in the north of Gaza continued to [stream south](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/15/gazas-evacuees-are-racing-south-with-nowhere-safe-to-go), after Israel’s armed forces told them to evacuate on Friday. But some, under heavy bombardment, have begun to return. Egypt has fortified its border, closing the only available exit. The situation inside the territory is desperate. Supplies of food, medicine and water are dwindling, though Israel did say it had marginally eased its siege by restoring the water supply to southern Gaza.

Israel’s northern border, meanwhile, is becoming more tense. The Israeli armed forces say they were attacked five times by anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon on Sunday; Hamas members there took credit for firing at least 20 rockets. Hizbullah, the powerful Lebanese Shia militant group, claims it does not want all-out war but will let Palestinian groups attack Israel—raising the danger that conflict will spread to a second front.

### Greece and Turkey resume talking

The [Gaza war](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/12/will-israels-agony-and-retribution-end-in-chaos-or-stability) may have thrown into jeopardy Turkey’s efforts to build bridges with Israel, but another of its troubled relationships appears to be improving. Turkish and Greek officials will meet on Monday to revive talks aimed at de-escalating tensions in the eastern Mediterranean. Since 2020 Turkey has been sending gas-exploration ships into Greek and Cypriot waters, prompting furious rebukes from Greece—and warnings from the EU and America.

For now Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, wants peace with his neighbour, knowing that his country’s economic recovery depends on foreign investment and restoring its standing in Europe. He laid the ground for the talks in July when he met Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Vilnius. In September the two countries’ foreign ministers met in Ankara. With [migration](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/12/the-eus-endless-search-for-a-migration-fix) in the Mediterranean still a hot topic, the [Cyprus question](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/11/18/putting-cyprus-together-may-be-impossible) festering and a [new crisis](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-atrocities-and-israels-retaliation-will-change-both-sides-for-ever) across the sea, the diplomats will have much to discuss.

### The western Balkans struggle towards the EU

In 2013 Croatia joined the European Union. On Monday the leaders of six of its western Balkan neighbours—Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia—will yet again meet to discuss their attempts to replicate the feat. The gathering in Tirana, Albania’s capital, is part of the Berlin Process, which is designed to foster regional cooperation alongside the reforms that each individual country must undertake to join the bloc.

Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, has said that he wants the EU and the countries to be ready for expansion by 2030. But there is widespread cynicism about the process across the region, which has been plodding towards EU accession since 2003—with little to show for it in recent years. Before the Ukraine war much of the EU was staunchly against [expansion](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/the-war-in-ukraine-is-a-powerful-reason-to-enlarge-and-improve-the-eu); Balkan countries, consequently, dawdled over meeting the requirements. Kosovo, unrecognised as a state by five EU members, cannot even become a candidate. Their leaders need serious political will to continue down their tedious track.

### Mozambique’s debt scandal in the dock

Ten years ago Credit Suisse, a Swiss bank, arranged a loan to a state-backed firm in Mozambique, ostensibly to finance the purchase of maritime-security equipment. This was the first of a series of debt deals involving various lenders to three state-backed firms; the total value reached $2bn. The debt caused an economic crisis and the country defaulted on it. On Monday [the saga](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/12/the-fallout-from-mozambiques-debt-scandal-reaches-a-london-court) reaches the High Court in London, where Mozambique’s government is suing Privinvest, a Lebanese group that supplied the security equipment, and its boss, Iskandar Safa. It is seeking more than $2bn in damages.

Mozambique alleges that the firm paid $136m in bribes. Privinvest and Mr Safa deny the allegations, saying that the payments were lawful. On October 1st the government reached an out-of-court settlement with Credit Suisse, which apparently agreed to waive repayments on the first loan. UBS Group, which completed a takeover of Credit Suisse in June, will be relieved to extricate itself from the mess.

### The tragic tale of the American buffalo

Tens of millions of American buffalo (or bison)—designated the “national mammal” in 2016—once roamed the North American continent. By 1860 their numbers had fallen to fewer than 15m; by 1900 only a few hundred remained.

References to the buffalos’ near-extinction have appeared several times in the works of Ken Burns, a prolific American filmmaker. Now in “The American Buffalo”, which airs in two parts on public television on Monday and Tuesday, the documentarian expands the “complex, tragic and at times hopeful” story of the species’ destruction and (partial) recovery.

The film concentrates on the millennia-long relationship between the bison and Native Americans, as related by tribal people from across the Great Plains. It details how white hunters slaughtered herds for their hides, in turn helping to “solve the Indian question”. Native Americans have been instrumental in boosting bison populations in the decades since. America now has around 500,000 of the beasts, though only a fraction are truly wild.
