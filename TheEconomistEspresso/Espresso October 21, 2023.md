## The world in brief

### October 21, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Hamas** released two **American hostages**, according to a spokesperson for the militant group and several media reports citing unnamed sources, including an Israeli defence official. The hostages, a mother and daughter, were reportedly handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza. Qatar had been mediating between America and Hamas to secure the release of hostages captured from Israel on October 7th. Earlier **Joe Biden** asked Congress to approve an aid package worth $105bn; it includes money and weapons for **Israel** and **Ukraine**, as well as humanitarian assistance for Gaza.

The UN’s secretary-general, **António Guterres**, visited the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing, as humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza were held up by disagreements over inspections. The [besieged enclave](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/israels-four-unpalatable-options-for-gazas-long-term-future) was due to receive water, food and medicine via Egypt on Friday, under an American-brokered deal with Israel. The death toll in Gaza passed 4,000 following another night of air raids.

In an internal election **Republicans** voted to drop Jim Jordan, a conservative hardliner, as their nominee for speaker of America’s House of Representatives, after he failed to get elected in the House for a third time. The House has been [without a speaker](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/19/americas-republicans-cannot-agree-on-a-speaker-good) since October 3rd. Republicans plan to hold another secret ballot next week to pick a new speaker nominee.

**American Express**, a pricey [credit-card company](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/05/15/the-old-bank/card-model-is-still-entrenched-in-the-rich-world), beat earnings expectations in the third quarter, posting a revenue of $15.4bn, compared with $13.6bn a year earlier. Customers spent 7% more on their Amex cards from July to September. But the company also expects more bad loans: it has set aside $1.2bn to cover losses, compared with just under $800m last year.

Another defendant in the **Georgia** [racketeering case](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/08/15/why-was-rico-a-mafia-targeting-act-used-to-charge-donald-trump) alleging a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election in favour of **Donald Trump** pleaded guilty. Kenneth Chesebro is the third co-defendant to take a plea deal, following Sidney Powell, another lawyer, and Scott Hall, a bondsman. All agreed to testify against the remaining defendants, including Mr Trump, who will probably stand trial next year.

Producer prices in **Germany** fell 14.7% year-on-year in September, the biggest drop since records began in 1949. The sudden tumble is in part a reversal of recent surges: wholesale prices jumped 45.8% on the year in September 2022, as energy prices shot up amid the war in Ukraine. Still, the larger-than-expected decline bodes well for the battle against inflation in [Europe’s largest economy](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/17/is-germany-once-again-the-sick-man-of-europe).

Italy’s prime minister, **Giorgia Meloni**, publicly split from her partner of ten years, Andrea Giambruno, a journalist, after recordings of his inappropriate sexual advances on colleagues were aired on national television. Ms Meloni said their “paths have diverged for some time”. They have a seven-year-old daughter together; [Ms Meloni](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/24/italys-hard-right-government-is-starting-to-look-more-radical) has been a champion of the nuclear family.

### A hamstrung peace summit in Egypt

The delegates gathering in Cairo on Saturday, from Arab countries and elsewhere, have an ambitious agenda: ending the war in Gaza, now in its third week. But it is probably a wasted effort. On Thursday Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, said a [ground offensive](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/as-israels-invasion-of-gaza-nears-the-obstacles-get-more-daunting) would soon start. “You will see [Gaza] from the inside,” he told troops massed on the border.

If the summit achieves anything, it will probably be to secure pledges of support for the 2m Palestinians under siege in Gaza since October 7th. Food, water and fuel are running out. After Israel agreed to lift its veto on the shipments, hopes were that some aid would start to flow across Egypt’s border with Gaza on Friday, but disagreements over how to screen supplies held up deliveries. Even the promised aid—20 lorries a day—would be just one-fifth of what the UN says is needed. The conference will not end the war, but mitigating its deadly consequences would be no small feat either.

### The final days of Ukraine’s counter-offensive

Ukrainian forces have perhaps just a couple more weeks before their counter-offensive gets stuck in the [autumnal mud](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/10/the-particular-problems-of-fighting-in-the-ukrainian-autumn). They may make one final push before time runs out: Russian military bloggers worry about an apparent build-up of troops on the Ukrainian-held bank of the Dnieper in the southern Kherson province, and the intermittent raids that Ukraine has carried out on the Russian-occupied side. Ukraine is possibly seeking to draw Russian forces away from the neighbouring Zaporizhia region. That could allow Ukraine to push towards the city of Tokmak, the recapture of which has become the minimum objective for the counter-offensive.

In truth, Ukraine will probably not achieve the goal, underlining the fact that its offensive has [failed](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/20/ukraines-sluggish-counter-offensive-is-souring-the-public-mood) to produce large territorial gains. Still, the months-long assault has not necessarily come to nothing. The Ukrainians have inflicted heavy losses of equipment and men on their enemy. That will hinder Russia’s ability to go on the offensive again when the mud dries up.

### The champions’ woes at the Cricket World Cup

England are in trouble at the [Cricket World Cup](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/06/the-cricket-world-cup-has-a-huge-hole-in-it) in India. Not since 1999 have the defending champions been kicked out at the group stage, but England are on the brink. During defeats to New Zealand and Afghanistan, the English batsmen—known for their aggression in recent years—were unusually timid. The bowlers, usually economical, conceded too many runs. The deeper problem could be motivation. The win in 2019 may have sated the hunger of the team, which is also the oldest in the competition.

On Saturday they face an effective eliminator against South Africa, themselves in danger of crashing out. The competition’s 15-man squads mean teams can make few changes. But England are hoping one will be enough: the reintroduction of Ben Stokes (pictured), their talismanic batsman who has been missing due to a hip injury. Mr Stokes has a history of dragging England out of holes. With six crucial games to go, Mr Stokes will have to do a lot of lifting.

### Radical, complicated English landscapes

Grey and gloomy, green and lush: Britain’s countryside has many faces and moods. That variety will be on display at “Radical Landscapes”, an exhibition about “art inspired by the land”, which opens on Saturday at the William Morris Gallery in London.

The exhibit will show more than 60 works. A young girl with windswept hair hula-hoops in Northumberland, rubbish and debris scattered about her, in a photograph taken by Chris Killip in 1984. Purple smoke obscures a vibrant orange sunset in south London in a painting from 1876 by John Ruskin. John Constable’s canvas of the Stour, from 1816, features a boy at work, a nod to the livelihood the river afforded his father, a miller.

Morris, a textile designer, who in the 1860s built one of the [world’s first global brands](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2012/09/22/more-than-just-a-pretty-swatch), was an early environmentalist. All of the “earth’s inhabitable surface” is beautiful, he said. “If we men will only abstain from wilfully destroying that beauty.”

### Weekend profile: Herzi Halevi, Israel’s battle chief

On October 18th Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi met pilots of an Israeli air-force squadron that had just carried out the targeted assassination of a senior Hamas commander. General Halevi, the chief of staff of the Israel Defence Forces, congratulated them on the killing of one of the men Israel believes led Hamas’s devastating terror attack on October 7th, in which around 1,400 people were killed—the heaviest loss of life in Israel in a single day. “We are working by the rules,” he said. “We’re all angry, but we’re using our heads. Fighting decisively and staying human beings.”

General Halevi was named for his uncle, a paratrooper killed in the six-day war between Israel and its Arab neighbours in 1967. He was drafted into the IDF in 1985, and has spent most of his 38-year military career as a paratrooper and special-forces officer at the sharp end of Israel’s operations in Gaza and Lebanon. That made him a stickler for discipline and military ethics. After Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza in 2008-09, he criticised other field commanders who had not set “moral standards” for their soldiers going into battle.

Now he is in command of armed forces that have more than tripled in size with the call-up of 360,000 reservists. It is expected to launch a major ground offensive in Gaza to destroy Hamas’s military and leadership capabilities imminently. But General Halevi is leading the Israeli army into battle with two huge burdens on his back. First, the mission of eradicating Hamas from Gaza cannot be achieved without widespread destruction and a heavy death toll in the north of the crowded coastal strip, testing his commitment to abiding by the [laws of war](https://www.economist.com/is-israel-acting-within-the-laws-of-war-in-gaza). Second, General Halevi bears some responsibility for the failure to foresee Hamas’s attack.

He has already acknowledged that failure. “The IDF is responsible for the security of the country and its citizens,” he said in a public statement. “And on Saturday morning in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip, we did not handle it.” Those who know him well insist he will resign once the battle is over. But for now, he will fight one last war.
