Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Antony Blinken**, America’s secretary of state, continued his shuttle diplomacy of the Middle East with an unannounced visit to **Iraq**. Earlier on Sunday he met Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the [Palestinian Authority](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/30/a-vision-for-the-palestinians-after-the-war) (PA), in Ramallah. Mr Abbas demanded an immediate [ceasefire](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/02/the-pace-of-israels-war-in-gaza-far-exceeds-previous-conflicts); Mr Blinken has been pushing for “humanitarian pauses” to let in aid to the Gaza Strip. The pair discussed a possible role of the PA in Gaza if [Hamas is destroyed](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/why-israel-must-fight-on). Mr Blinken now moves on to Turkey.

**Fighting** [intensified](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/4/israel-hamas-war-live-heavy-israeli-bombing-pounds-northern-gaza) in the **Gaza Strip**. Israeli troops claim to have split the enclave in two, and to have encircled Gaza city. **Israel** accused Hamas of the “systematic” use of hospitals to [hide its military operations](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/30/why-urban-warfare-in-gaza-will-be-bloodier-than-in-iraq)—including an underground command-and-control centre and a rocket launcher. Its troops found launch pads metres away from a children’s swimming pool and playground. Meanwhile, **Gaza’s** Hamas-controlled government said that an Israeli air strike on a refugee camp had killed at least 45 people.

A year to the day before **America’s presidential election**, an opinion poll for the *New York Times* found that voters in five battleground states—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania—preferred [Donald Trump](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/31/donald-trumps-second-term-would-be-a-protectionist-nightmare) over [Joe Biden](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/26/american-power-indispensable-or-ineffective). The likely Republican contender enjoyed a lead of between four and ten points over the incumbent. Respondents unhappy with Mr Biden cited his age, as well as his handling of the [economy](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/28/americas-next-government-shutdown-could-be-the-strangest-yet), [foreign policy](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/18/joe-biden-has-shown-a-steady-hand-in-the-gaza-crisis) and [immigration](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/12/joe-biden-should-admit-republicans-are-partly-right-about-border-security).

**Elon Musk’s** startup, xAI, launched a beta version of a [generative-AI chatbot](https://www.economist.com/interactive/science-and-technology/2023/04/22/large-creative-ai-models-will-transform-how-we-live-and-work) designed to rival [ChatGPT](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/21/chatgpt-mania-may-be-cooling-but-a-serious-new-industry-is-taking-shape). After testing, **Grok** will be available to premium subscribers of X (formerly Twitter) at $16 per month. Mr Musk said his bot will draw real-time knowledge about the world from X. He has previously threatened to sue Microsoft for accessing his social-media platform to train ChatGPT, which the software giant part-owns.

**Turkey’s** main opposition party voted to remove its leader, [Kemal Kilicdaroglu](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/05/05/a-more-democratic-turkey-is-within-grasp-says-kemal-kilicdaroglu). Mr Kilicdaroglu has led the Republican People’s Party, or CHP, since 2010, but has repeatedly [failed to unseat](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/28/recep-tayyip-erdogan-is-re-elected-as-turkeys-president) Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country’s autocratic president. Mr Kilicdaroglu was replaced by Ozgur Ozel, who promised to expand the CHP’s appeal before local elections in March.

**South Korea** reimposed a ban on **short-selling** for stocks of large companies. Regulators said they wanted to level the playing-field for institutional and retail investors. Restrictions on the practice had been lifted in May 2021 in an [attempt to improve the appeal of the country’s capital markets](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/15/south-korea-has-had-enough-of-being-called-an-emerging-market) to foreign investors. The **Philippines** opted for the opposite approach, allowing short-selling for the first time.

A UN report said that the cultivation of **opium poppies** in Afghanistan had fallen by 95% since the Taliban [criminalised their farming](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/22/the-taliban-have-launched-an-impressive-new-war-on-drugs) in April 2022. When the Taliban returned to power in 2021, Afghanistan was the source of 85% of the world’s opium. Afghan farmers have lost an estimated $1bn in income from opium sales since the start of the crackdown.

### The weakening world economy

For most of 2023 the world economy has been resilient amid high interest rates and rising geopolitical tensions. [That could be changing.](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/02/markets-think-interest-rates-could-stay-high-for-a-decade-or-more) In October America’s labour market slowed. On Monday surveys of businesses in Europe may reveal further weakness; on Tuesday economists will also pore over trade data from China, which has been struggling with a crisis in its property market.

Might a [global recession strike](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/the-world-economy-is-defying-gravity-that-cannot-last)? That depends in part on how central banks respond to any weakness. Markets rallied after America’s jobs report because a slower economy usually means lower inflation—and hence lower interest rates. But should war spread in the Middle East monetary policymakers might have to deal with higher oil prices and another round of inflationary supply shocks. And central bankers are wary of declaring victory over price rises too hastily, especially in [fast-growing America](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/29/americas-economy-is-booming-why-arent-its-bosses-happier). They are unlikely to cut interest rates any time soon.

### Israel’s ground operation takes shape

As the week begins, the shape of Israel’s ground offensive is becoming clear. Its troops are already in the outlying neighbourhoods of Gaza city, and are preparing for an assault on the Hamas headquarters in the city’s [crowded centre](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/30/why-urban-warfare-in-gaza-will-be-bloodier-than-in-iraq). The Israeli army has a clear advantage in firepower and armour, but Hamas has an extensive tunnel system under Gaza in which its leadership can take shelter. It can also use the network to launch ambushes on the Israeli tanks.

Nearly 10,000 people have been [killed in the Gaza Strip](https://www.economist.com/interactive/the-economist-explains/2023/10/30/how-many-people-have-died-in-gaza) in the past month, most in air strikes launched by Israel following the murder of 1,400 of its people on October 7th. There is mounting [international pressure](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/26/american-power-indispensable-or-ineffective) on Israel to agree to a “humanitarian pause” that would allow more civilians to flee the enclave’s north. Israeli officers are therefore aware that time is running out for them to [achieve their objective](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/why-israel-must-fight-on) of destroying Hamas’s military capabilities. As they ramp up their efforts, the most devastating fighting may lie ahead.

### BioNtech’s rough patch

Germany’s biotech *wunderkind* will report earnings for the third quarter on Monday. The Mainz-based company, which in 2020 created the first [effective covid vaccine](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/01/04/biontechs-founder-on-the-future-of-mrna-technology) in co-operation with Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical giant, has lately been [under the weather](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/08/10/after-a-covid-fuelled-adrenaline-rush-biotech-is-crashing). Its share price has fallen by more than 35% this year, owing to a slump in demand for covid-related drugs.

BioNTech relies on profit-sharing payments from Pfizer for a big chunk of its revenue. In mid-October BioNTech said that it is likely to take a writedown of €900m ($966m) after Pfizer reduced its forecast for covid-vaccine sales by about $2bn this year. To calm investors, the German firm pointed out that, according to Pfizer, most of the write-offs relate to raw materials purchased during the pandemic, as well as older versions of the covid vaccine that are no longer in use. But it may take more than that for BioNtech to regain its star power.

### Indonesia’s economy and Jokowi’s legacy

Strong domestic consumption and a juicy trade surplus bode well for the release of Indonesia’s third-quarter GDP figures on Monday. Economists polled by Reuters think that South-East Asia’s largest economy grew by just over 5% in the last year. For the last six months headline inflation has remained within the central bank’s target range of 2-4%. It has, though, lately begun to inch up as drought has pushed up the price of rice, a vital commodity in the world’s fourth-most populous country.

Jokowi, as [Indonesia’s president](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/10/26/jokowi-is-building-a-political-dynasty) is known, took power in 2014 on a promise of 7% annual economic growth. That has proved elusive: since then the figure has hovered at around 5%. In February Indonesia will elect a new president. Jokowi predicts that his 7% aspiration is achievable by 2027 if his successor maintains his reforms, including building infrastructure and expanding Indonesia’s nickel manufacturing. [Not everyone agrees](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/07/what-will-indonesia-look-like-after-jokowi-leaves).

### Russia’s modern history in a dish

In 1961, minutes before Yuri Gagarin, a Soviet test pilot, took off in the [first-ever manned spaceflight](https://www.economist.com/babbage/2011/04/12/the-space-age-future-that-never-happened), the lead rocket engineer told him that he had 63 tubes of pulverised space food packed. His first meal included vegetable soup and liver paté. “The main thing is the sausage, for chasing hooch,” the Soviet cosmonaut responded.

The recently declassified recording is just one bite from Witold Szablowski’s “What’s Cooking in the Kremlin”, released in English this week. The [Polish journalist](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/08/21/the-heirs-to-ryszard-kapuscinski-polands-best-known-journalist) tells the modern history of the Soviet Union and Russia through accounts of its cooks. He tracks down those who staffed the Kremlin’s kitchen from the times of Lenin up to Russia’s current leader, Vladimir Putin.

He also looks inside the canteens of Chernobyl’s exclusion zone, right after the [nuclear disaster](https://www.economist.com/europe/2016/04/26/a-nuclear-disaster-that-brought-down-an-empire), and the bakeries of besieged wartime Leningrad. His stories of food are often about the lack of it, such as during a famine that [killed millions in Soviet Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/09/30/stalins-famine-a-war-on-ukraine) in 1932-33. Russian dominance, wielded with a knife and fork.
