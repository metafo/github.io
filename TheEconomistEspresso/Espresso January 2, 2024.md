### January 2, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Waves of around one metre hit parts of **Japan’s** coast, after several [earthquakes](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/31/japan-is-preparing-for-a-massive-earthquake), including one of 7.6 magnitude, struck the country. Authorities downgraded a tsunami warning from the highest level, but asked residents from evacuated areas not to return to their homes. Dozens of houses collapsed and at least four people were killed. More than 36,000 households lost access to electricity.

**Israel’s Supreme Court** struck down a controversial law that would have limited its powers. [In July](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/24/a-blow-against-israels-supreme-court-plunges-the-country-into-crisis) the parliament, the Knesset, passed the law that all but eliminates the court’s ability to overturn government decisions on grounds of “reasonableness”, sparking nationwide protests. The ruling could cause a constitutional crisis as Israel fights a prolonged war in Gaza.

An **Iranian** warship entered the **Red Sea**, according to the country’s media. Tensions have been rising in the crucial [shipping route](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/12/19/attacks-on-shipping-in-the-red-sea-are-a-blow-to-global-trade). On Saturday Iran-backed Houthi militants from Yemen attacked a container ship belonging to Maersk, a Danish shipping giant, causing it to temporarily suspend sailings through the route. On Sunday American navy helicopters destroyed three Houthi attack vessels and killed ten militants.

A court in **Bangladesh** sentenced [Muhammad Yunus](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/24/the-trials-of-muhammad-yunus), a Nobel-winning entrepreneur, to six months in prison. Mr Yunus and three associates are accused of failing to pay benefits to workers at Grameen Telecom, a not-for-profit firm. They will appeal the ruling. Mr Yunus’s allies say it is the latest salvo in a decade-long political campaign waged against him by Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s prime minister, ahead of general elections on January 7th.

Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, vowed to “intensify” attacks on **Ukraine**. On Saturday Ukraine shelled Belgorod, a **Russian** city near the Ukrainian border, killing 25 people, according to local officials. Mr Putin called the attack a “deliberate strike against civilians”. Meanwhile, in [an interview](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/01/a-new-years-interview-with-volodymr-zelensky) with *The Economist* Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said he does not detect “any fundamental steps forward to the peace from Russia”.

A [global minimum tax](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/a-global-minimum-tax-on-firms-is-finally-taking-shape) on **multinational companies** came into force in several countries. It is the product of a deal struck in 2021 by more than 130 countries decreeing that no big firm should pay tax at a rate lower than 15%. Countries may collect “top-up” taxes from companies that make use of tax havens. The OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, says annual tax revenue could rise by $220bn worldwide.

The **Indian Space Research Organisation** launched XPoSat, a $30m satellite that will be used to study black holes. It is the second such mission after NASA launched a similar space observatory in 2021. India’s space agency has been expanding its ambitions. In August it successfully landed a spacecraft on [the Moon](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/23/indias-lunar-triumph)—only the fourth country to do so.

### Israel’s long war in Gaza

On Monday Israel’s army said that it would start withdrawing some troops from [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/30/israel-prepares-for-a-long-war-in-gaza). Reservists from two brigades are to be sent home this week; three others would return to Israel for training. The mobilisation of more than 300,000 reservists has been a strain on the country’s economy–it may have contracted by 2% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Sending some people home may help ease a labour shortage. It could also appease President Joe Biden, who has pushed Israel to shift its tactics in Gaza.

But it does not signal an end to the war. Daniel Hagari, the army spokesman, said there is “prolonged fighting” ahead in 2024. The UN says 85% of Gaza’s 2.2m people have been displaced. The World Food Programme warns of looming famine: 26% of the population is already facing extreme hunger. For residents of Gaza, the new year may prove even bleaker than the last one.

### After Congo’s election

Félix Tshisekedi, the incumbent president of [Congo](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/14/congos-crucial-election-may-be-heading-for-disaster), was declared the winner of the country’s election with a thumping tally of 73%. Yet nine rival candidates, including the runner-up Moïse Katumbi, have rejected the results and demanded a re-run, declaring the election was a “farce”.

The vote on December 20th was extended for a second day after almost 60% of polling stations opened late and nearly 15% did not open, according to one observer group. In some remote regions voting appeared to be ongoing five days later. Turnout was 43%, the lowest since elections returned in 2006.

An opposition protest on December 27th was violently broken up by police. As the results were announced on December 31st, the army was deployed in parts of Kinshasa, the capital. Mr Katumbi says he will not challenge the results in court because they are not independent. Any attempts to do so in the street are likely to be met with crackdowns.

### Europe’s industry hopes for a better 2024

Industry around the world is stuck. Surveys show that global manufacturers, which experienced a boom after the covid pandemic, largely stagnated in 2023. In Europe, it has been [considerably worse](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/12/europes-economy-is-in-a-bad-way-policymakers-need-to-react). The sector is in a severe downturn and the latest production figures from October showed a continued decline. Might 2024 be the year when things turn around? The release on Tuesday of the eurozone’s widely-watched purchasing managers’ index (PMI) could point to a slightly brighter outlook.

Production numbers may still have some way to go. The Austrian release from last week still shows a steep decline. The global outlook has not improved much either. China’s PMI numbers for manufacturing declined for a third month in a row in December. But the forward-looking parts of Austria’s latest questionnaire received more positive feedback, signalling that things might be bottoming out. After a bad year, things can only get better.

### Indonesia’s steady economy

On Tuesday Indonesia will publish annual inflation figures. The inflation rate is expected to have been well within the central bank’s target range of 2-4% in 2023. It was a steady year for the country’s economy: the growth rate hovered at 5% year on year. In 2024 growth is expected to ease slightly as commodity prices fall. The rupiah, meanwhile, has weakened perhaps because of political uncertainty ahead of presidential elections in February.

The election will see Joko Widodo, popularly known as [Jokowi](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/07/what-will-indonesia-look-like-after-jokowi-leaves), step down as president. During his ten-year tenure, Indonesia has been the fifth-fastest-growing of the world’s 30 biggest economies. This has been driven by ambitious infrastructure projects, including a $34bn scheme to build Nusantara, a new capital, and the development of the nickel industry. Both leading candidates to replace him, Prabowo Subianto and Ganjar Pranowo, say they will continue Mr Widodo’s economic policies. Whoever wins, big change is not likely.

### Sports stars to watch in 2024

The main event in sport in 2024 will be the Olympics in [Paris](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/france-will-unify-for-sport-but-not-for-politics). Athletics fans will watch the progress of Noah Lyles, an American sprinter. The 26-year-old won the 100-metre and 200-metre sprints at the World Athletics Championships in 2023 and is bullish about his chances in 2024.

Outside of the Olympics, other potential winners include Oleksandr Usyk, a Ukrainian boxer, who will probably defeat Tyson Fury in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital. That would make him the first undisputed heavyweight boxing champion since 1999. Floridian Coco Gauff, a 19-year-old tennis star, could add to her US Open title by winning one of the four grand slams.

And pressure, as ever, will be piled on England’s football team. After strong performances at the previous European Championship and the World Cup, the highly experienced team has a chance at this year’s European Championships in Germany. And they now have one of the world’s finest midfielders, Jude Bellingham, at their core.
