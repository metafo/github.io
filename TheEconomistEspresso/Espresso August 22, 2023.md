## The world in brief

### August 22, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**President Biden** appointed an emergency-relief manager to coordinate the federal government’s response in Hawaii. The announcement, reported from Air Force One, came as Mr Biden travelled to Maui—his first visit since [wildfires](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/17/lessons-from-the-blaze-that-levelled-lahaina) killed at least 114 people there. Meanwhile tropical storm **Hilary** brought [record-breaking rainfall](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/07/26/the-high-tech-race-to-improve-weather-forecasting) to Los Angeles, San Diego and other parts of southern California, causing flooding and mudslides. Officials in Los Angeles said that no deaths were reported. In Mexico, earlier hit by Storm Hilary, at least one person died.

**Donald Trump’s** lawyers reached an agreement with the prosecutor’s office in Georgia, setting his bond at $200,000. Mr Trump is due to appear at the courthouse in Atlanta by Friday to be arraigned on [racketeering charges](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/15/donald-trumps-racketeering-indictment-is-the-most-sweeping-yet) (he denies wrongdoing). The indictment is the second to allege election interference, and the first to seemingly require the former president to pay a cash bond.

**Ecuadorians** voted to ban oil drilling in part of Yasuní National Park in the Amazon, one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. Environmentalist and Indigenous groups applauded the outcome, but others, including a government minister, expressed concern about losing revenue from the country’s biggest oil reserve. The government must dismantle operations and reforest the impacted area in the coming months.

**Bernardo Arevalo**, an anti-corruption candidate, won a landslide victory in Guatemala’s presidential election. Mr Arevalo, standing for the left-leaning Seed party, won 58% of the vote against his opponent Sandra Torres, a former first lady, with 99% of ballots counted. But many fear that **Guatemala’s** conservative establishment [may yet try](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/08/17/guatemalas-elite-may-try-to-scupper-the-presidential-election) to keep him out of power.

**Lucy Letby**, a former nurse convicted of killing seven babies and attempting to murder six more, was sentenced to a whole-life term, with no chance of parole, by a court in Manchester. She is the fourth woman in Britain to ever receive such a sentence. The government said it plans to compel convicts to attend sentencing after Ms Letby refused to appear in court.

**Saudi** guards killed hundreds of Ethiopian migrants trying to cross the border from [Yemen](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/09/can-yemen-hold-together), a report by Human Rights Watch alleges. The NGO says that border guards used explosive weapons against migrants in a “systematic pattern of attack”. Saudi Arabia has denied earlier accusations of widespread border violence. The latest attacks allegedly took place between March 2022 and June 2023.

**Somalia** banned online platforms including TikTok, a video-sharing app, and Telegram, a messaging service, amid a crackdown on insurgent activity. The government said that “terrorists and immoral groups” use the apps to spread “horrific images and misinformation”. Somalia’s president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, recently suggested he would destroy [al-Shabaab](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/25/drought-killed-43000-people-in-somalia-last-year), an insurgent group linked to al-Qaeda, within five months.

### The BRICS meet

The [15th summit](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/17/the-brics-are-getting-together-in-south-africa) of the BRICS—a club made up of Brazil, China, India, Russia and South Africa—opens in Johannesburg in South Africa on Tuesday. Its members want to be regarded as a rival to the G7, a group of rich countries. They now contain 41% of the world’s population and produce 26% of its GDP. The bloc, which has its origin in an acronym thought up in 2001 by a British economist for an American bank, sees itself as the pre-eminent forum for criticism of the Western-led international order.

Whether it can create an alternative order is unclear. The five members are very different politically and economically, and are divided over the group’s future. Russia and China would like the bloc to add countries and to criticise America more. Brazil, India and South Africa—all democracies—endorse diplomatic neutrality and are wary of enlargement. Such disunity means that the BRICS will have less global clout than they hope to.

### Thailand’s new leadership

After more than three months of political deadlock, Thailand’s parliament is expected to vote in a new prime minister on Tuesday. Srettha Thavisin, a former property tycoon, is poised to become the country’s leader after the military establishment [blocked](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/18/the-humiliation-of-thailands-regime-is-a-boost-for-asian-democracy) the progressive Move Forward party, which won the most votes in Thailand’s general election in May, from forming a government.

In a stunning policy reversal, Pheu Thai, Mr Srettha’s populist party, is teaming up with ten other parties including its former rivals, the country’s two largest pro-military parties, with whom Pheu Thai once said it would never work. Many Thai voters disapprove of the new coalition government.

But that’s not all. Pheu Thai is linked to a former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who left the country in 2008 because he faces multiple criminal charges that he claims are politically motivated. He now looks set to return to the country. It could be a big day in Thai politics.

### Macy’s woes

Macy’s, a stalwart American retailer, reports its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Its results seem set to be more rags than riches: operating profits of around $80m are expected, an 80% drop from the same period last year.

The country’s shoppers are cutting back as rising costs begin to bite. Spending growth slowed to 1.6% year on year in the second quarter, from 4.2% in the first. Simultaneously credit-card debt soared, hitting a record $1trn—a sure sign that savings are being depleted. Student-loan repayments are set to resume this autumn, which will pile more pressure on American consumers. Retailers are already anticipating the pain; in June Macy’s slashed its earnings outlook for this year.

The department store is now trying to refashion its fortunes. In July it launched a new women’s-clothing line—the first of a planned four by 2025—in a bid to attract younger customers. If it cannot, its prospects will look a little worse for wear.

### Texas considers a makeshift border

On Tuesday a federal court in Texas will consider an injunction filed by the Biden administration that would force the state to remove a barrier blocking migrants from crossing the Rio Grande river. Since July, a string of large orange buoys has floated between Eagle Pass, Texas, and the Mexican town of Piedras Negras.

The Department of Justice argues that the buoys defy the so-called Rivers and Harbours Act by obstructing passage of a major river. Greg Abbott, the state’s Republican governor, counters that “Texas has the sovereign authority” to defend its border. The buoys are part of Operation Lone Star, a campaign that Mr Abbott launched in 2021 to stop migrants and drugs entering Texas from Mexico.

It is not the first time a state has tried to take immigration policy into its own hands: Arizona dismantled a border wall made of shipping containers in January, under pressure from the federal government. Given America’s [toxic immigration politics](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/18/it-turns-out-that-democrats-bus-migrants-too), it probably won’t be the last, either.

### Record-breaking runners

Athletes tend to break world records by small amounts: a tenth of a second here, a few centimetres there. But in June a Kenyan runner, Faith Kipyegon, smashed the women’s 1,500m record, which had stood for eight years, by 96 hundredths of a second. A week later, she beat the 5,000m record by more than a second. In July she ran a mile almost five seconds faster than any other woman in history. She is the overwhelming favourite to win both the 1,500m and the 5,000m at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest. The 1500m final takes place on Tuesday.

Jakob Ingebrigtsen will be hoping for similar success in the men’s 1500m. Remarkably, the Norwegian Olympic champion has yet to win a world title in his favourite event. He finished fourth in 2019 after a performance he described candidly as “hopeless” and only managed second place in 2022. But after a strong 2023 season, he is odds-on to be third time lucky.
