Israel rejected a [ceasefire proposal](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315220726/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/10/the-bloodshed-in-gaza-is-set-to-rage-through-ramadan) by Hamas. The offer, reported by Reuters, was based on a two-stage agreement whereby Israeli hostages—women, children and the elderly first among them—would be released in exchange for more than 700 Palestinian prisoners. The second stage would involve discussions of a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces in Gaza. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said it was a “ridiculous” proposal based on “unrealistic demands”. However, Mr Netanyahu said that Israeli officials would travel to Qatar to proceed with negotiations.

Russia launched a missile attack on Odessa, a Ukrainian city on the Black Sea coast, killing at least 20 people and injuring more than 75. The city has often been targeted by [Russia](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315220726/https://www.economist.com/interactive/europe/2024/03/13/vladivostok-is-a-window-into-wartime-russia) due to its tactical, symbolic and economic significance. It is home to a vast port, vital to Ukraine’s Black Sea exports.

The G7 warned Iran that it would be hit by retaliatory measures if it continued to supply Russia with military equipment. In a statement, the group of big economies said that Tehran was considering “transferring ballistic missiles and related technology to Russia”. The G7 is concerned by the fact that Iran is[ deepening](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315220726/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/14/irans-regime-is-weaker-than-it-looks-and-therefore-more-pliable) its ties with Russia.

Apple reached a $490m preliminary settlement over accusations that Tim Cook, its chief executive, had concealed falling demand for its products in China from investors. Mr Cook claimed in November 2018 that iPhone sales in the country were strong, but in January 2019 [the company](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315220726/https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/24/what-could-bring-apple-down) said its revenues would be $9bn lower than projected—and its shares fell by 10%.

America’s National Association of Realtors settled lawsuits with home-sellers, paying $418m in damages and agreeing to change its rules on extortionate commission fees.

The deal, which still needs to be approved by a federal court, could make it [much easier](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315220726/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/08/29/why-americas-real-estate-brokers-are-such-a-rip-off) for people to move.

Honda and Nissan announced that they are exploring making electric vehicles together to help them compete with [Chinese carmakers](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315220726/https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/11/western-firms-are-quaking-as-chinas-electric-car-industry-speeds-up). The scope of the partnership is not yet clear but Japan’s second- and third-largest carmakers would potentially collaborate on artificial intelligence and producing key components. Japanese carmakers are struggling to break into the EV market.

A judge in New York agreed to a 30-day delay of Donald Trump’s trial for allegedly falsifying documents to cover up a sex scandal. It had been scheduled to start on March 25th, but on Thursday prosecutors signalled they were willing to wait, to review newly received evidence.

### Lib Dems court Conservatives

With a British general election expected this year, the Liberal Democrats are meeting for their spring conference in York this weekend. The junior partners in the coalition government of 2010-15 have been badly reduced in recent years: they are the fourth-largest party by seats in the Westminster Parliament, behind the Scottish National Party. According to *The Economist*’s [poll tracker](https://www.economist.com/interactive/uk-general-election/polls), they have slipped to fourth place in vote share behind Reform, a right-wing insurgent party. On Tuesday Reform staged a coup by recruiting Lee Anderson, an ex-Conservative MP who recently claimed that Islamists controlled London’s Muslim mayor.

Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dems’ leader, hopes to end his party’s poor run by focusing on disaffected Conservative voters with liberal, pro-EU tendencies in seats in the London commuter belt. The party argues that Tory politicians’ conduct has become fetid. It seems to be trying to keep that theme in voters’ minds by making sewage dumping a focus of its campaigns.

### India’s campaign kicks off

On Saturday India’s election commission announced that it will hold a seven-phase general election, beginning on April 19th. Results will be announced on June 4th. With 945m people eligible to vote, many of them in remote places, the largest democratic exercise in history will be an enormous logistical challenge.

Narendra Modi is widely expected to win a third term—but the past week was an awkward one for the prime minister and his Bharatiya Janata Party. On Thursday the election commission published details about companies and people who had bought electoral bonds. Last month the Supreme Court [deemed](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/02/15/indias-supreme-court-delivers-a-rare-setback-for-narendra-modi) these controversial campaign-finance instruments unconstitutional. They were introduced by Mr Modi’s government in 2018 and had mainly benefited the BJP. Then, on Friday, the government rushed to appoint two new election commissioners seen as loyal to Mr Modi before the court could hear a challenge to the appointment process. Expect a tumultuous campaign.

### Mother’s milk from an unlikely source

Slimy, venomous and alien-looking, the ringed caecilian could have slithered out of a child’s nightmare. This creature is neither worm nor snake, but rather an egg-laying amphibian, native to South America’s marshy forests. Look beyond its chthonic appearance, however, and you will find something more tender: the mammalian ability to feed “milk” to its young. According to a new paper in *Science*, a journal, caecilians have joined a small list of non-mammalian animals that can do so.

Experts observing caecilians noticed the hatchlings nuzzling at their mother’s vent, an opening at her tail end. Apparently in response to the touches and sounds of her babies, the mother secretes a thick clear fluid from glands inside her reproductive tract. Chemical analysis revealed the fluid is rich in fats and carbohydrates, similar to mammalian milk. The discovery makes caecilians’ parenting style unique among amphibians—no others communicate with their offspring in this way. It might make them seem a little more friendly, too.

### A competitive Six Nations

In the Six Nations, an annual international rugby tournament, teams who win all their matches achieve a “Grand Slam”. After victories over France, Italy and Wales, Ireland looked set to become the first team to do so twice in a row since the tournament expanded in 2000. But last weekend Ireland unexpectedly lost to an inspired England side. Victory or a draw against Scotland in Saturday’s final round of matches will still ensure they win the tournament. But failing to claim another Slam will be a disappointment—especially after the much fancied side crashed out in the quarter-finals of last year’s World Cup.

Elsewhere, the tournament has been encouraging for the [Italians](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/12/how-rugby-became-a-darling-of-europes-chauvinist-right), who have beaten Scotland and drawn against France. Scotland humbled arch-rivals England but remained maddeningly inconsistent. France also struggled for steady form. This year’s Six Nations has been highly competitive, but that has prevented any team from imposing themselves.

### Weekend profile: Jimmy Chérizier, Haiti’s top gang leader

In the days after Haiti’s gangs took advantage of a trip abroad by Ariel Henry, the prime minister, to [seize control of prisons and police stations](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/03/14/haiti-is-locked-in-a-doom-loop-of-insecurity-and-illegitimacy), one man seemed to have authority. Jimmy “Barbecue” Chérizier, the country’s most prominent warlord, was as present and vocal as Mr Henry was absent and silent. On Tuesday Mr Chérizier achieved his stated aim: Mr Henry said he would resign as soon as a transitional government was in place.

Mr Chérizier appears to have political ambitions. As foreign leaders discussed the contours of a transitional government, he warned that international decisions would plunge Haiti into “further chaos”; he then promised he would “figure out how to get Haiti out of the misery it’s in now”. But Mr Chérizier himself is responsible for much of that misery. He leads the G-9, a group that began with nine gangs and has since expanded. They are among the 300 gangs that control 80% of the capital.

Mr Chérizier portrays himself as the champion of the people in the Caribbean nation of 11.6m. The youngest of eight children, he grew up in a slum in Port-au-Prince. He says his father died when he was a child and that his mother sold fried chicken on the street. (That, he claims, is the origin of his nickname, “Barbecue”, rather than any reference to setting his enemies on fire.) Mr Chérizier went on to join the Haitian police, one of the few decent jobs in the desperately poor country.

But the police sacked him in 2018 for alleged abuses, including taking part in a massacre at La Saline, a slum, in which at least 71 people died and 400 homes burned. Soon after, he was taking part in gang-led massacres in Port-au-Prince; he has subsequently been involved in many more. In 2020 he founded the G-9. Both the United States and the UN have imposed sanctions on Mr Chérizier. He has said that fighting with guns is necessary and that he is inspired by François Duvalier, also known as “Papa Doc”, a brutal dictator who ruled Haiti from 1957 to 1971.

Mr Chérizier may disrupt plans both for a transitional government and for the deployment of a security force authorised by the UN and led by Kenya. It cannot begin its mission while there is no government in Haiti. It is hard to imagine that Mr Chérizier, having come so far, will retreat into the background.
