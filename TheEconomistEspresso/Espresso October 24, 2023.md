The Red Cross said that it had “facilitated” the release of two more **hostages** taken by **Hamas,** and had transported them out of Gaza on Monday evening. According to media reports they are elderly Israeli women. On Friday the militant group freed two other hostages, an American-Israeli mother and daughter; Hamas is still holding more than 200 people in Gaza, according to the Israel Defence Forces. More than 5,000 people have died in the enclave since October 7th, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run Ministry of Health. **Israel** has ramped up air strikes, claiming to have hit 320 targets in 24 hours, ahead of an [expected ground invasion](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/22/israels-window-of-legitimacy-in-gaza-is-shrinking).

**Chevron**, an energy giant, will buy Hess Corporation, a smaller American oil firm, in a $53bn all-stock deal, betting on America’s shale patch and increasing its footprint in oil-rich Guyana. Recently supermajors’ shale ambitions have grown, as it has become more profitable. Earlier this month ExxonMobil, another major, said it would acquire [Pioneer](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/11/why-exxonmobil-is-paying-60bn-for-pioneer) for $60bn in one of the biggest oil mergers ever.

**America’s** ten-year **Treasury** [yields](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/04/a-surge-in-global-bond-yields-threatens-trouble) rose above 5% for the first time since 2007, as investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates higher for longer to keep inflation down. America’s economy has proved surprisingly resilient to tighter monetary policy, suggesting a delayed path to interest-rate cuts.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, **Turkey’s** president, submitted a bill approving **Sweden’s NATO membership** to parliament for a vote. Mr Erdogan had for months [blocked](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/10/why-is-turkey-blocking-sweden-from-joining-nato) Sweden’s bid to join the bloc, ostensibly because the Nordic country harboured Kurdish separatists. It is not clear when Turkey’s parliament will vote to ratify the bid.

[María Corina Machado](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/06/29/if-venezuelas-elections-were-fair-this-would-be-the-front-runner) is poised to become **Venezuela’s** presidential opposition candidate. With 26% of the vote counted, she had won 93% in the primary election, a contest between 10 opposition candidates. She is expected to take on Nicolás Maduro, the country’s authoritarian president, in an election due in 2024. Mr Maduro’s government [faces pressure](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/10/19/joe-biden-lifts-sanctions-on-venezuela-but-not-without-conditions) to reverse its ban on Ms Machado, a conservative, from holding office.

**Sahra Wagenknecht**, a popular German left-wing politician, announced the founding of a new political party. Ms Wagenknecht and nine other politicians resigned from their former party, Die Linke (The Left), which she has previously criticised over its support of sanctions against Russia. The new group, initially called the “Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht”, promises to focus on “reason and justice” and socially conservative values.

Katrin Jakobsdottir, **Iceland’s** prime minister, will strike on Tuesday to protest against the gender pay gap and gender-based violence. She joins tens of thousands of Icelandic women who will refuse to work or do household chores in the country’s first full-day women’s strike since 1975. Iceland ranks among [the world’s most gender-equal](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/glass-ceiling-index) countries, but activists say full equality is still lacking.

### Alphabet and Microsoft prosper, but not because of AI

Alphabet, Google’s parent, and Microsoft will on Tuesday kick off a massive week in big-tech earnings reports. Meta and Amazon will follow on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Both Alphabet and Microsoft are expected to post their best results for some time.

Analysts will be studying particularly closely the numbers for each company’s cloud-computing and artificial-intelligence businesses. They want to know whether growth in cloud computing is picking up again after a few quarters of slowdown. The question about AI is whether both firms have started making profits from the billions of dollars [they have invested](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/27/how-microsoft-could-supplant-apple-as-the-worlds-most-valuable-firm). The answer will probably be disappointing, at least in Microsoft’s case. It is reportedly losing money on many of the users of “Copilot”, an AI assistant for many of its online services. Providing such tools gobbles up a lot of expensive computing power.

### The UN’s nuclear watchdog in Japan

In August the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant started discharging over 1m tonnes of [wastewater](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/07/13/asia-is-rowing-about-fukushima-nuclear-wastewater) into the Pacific Ocean. The water, which was used to cool reactors after the triple disaster in 2011, contains a small amount of tritium, a radioactive isotope. The International Atomic Energy Agency says its health impact is “negligible”. Nonetheless, on Tuesday an IAEA task force will visit Fukushima to test the water.

The results will be closely scrutinised. China, once the biggest importer of Japanese seafood, imposed a blanket ban on Japanese seafood immediately after the discharge started. Kishida Fumio, Japan’s prime minister, urged China to change tack and rolled out subsidies to help the local fishing industry. [Criticising Japan](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/30/china-is-stoking-anger-over-japans-release-of-nuclear-wastewater) is a convenient political tool for China to distract its citizens from the country’s economic woes. Despite the cajoling from the scientific community, it is hard to tell whether China will reverse the ban.

### Macron’s belated trip to Israel

Emmanuel Macron arrives in Israel on Tuesday for his first trip there since Hamas’s attack on October 7th, in which 30 French citizens were killed. France’s president is one of the later European leaders to visit. Germany’s Olaf Scholz, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Britain’s Rishi Sunak went last week, following an earlier—and [clumsier](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/the-eus-response-to-the-crisis-in-israel-exposes-its-limits)—visit by the European Commission’s head, Ursula von der Leyen.

Mr Macron will seek to send a balanced message: solidarity with Israel and support for its right to defend itself from terrorism, combined with a plea that it respects international humanitarian law and does not target civilians. He will also discuss the plight of possibly seven French hostages, call for a “humanitarian pause” and raise the longer-term need to open a political path towards the creation of a viable Palestinian state. Mr Macron’s visit takes place amid worries that the conflict will worsen tensions at home. On October 13th a teacher was killed in northern France in an attack that prosecutors classified as an act of Islamist terrorism.

### Delayed gratification for Poland’s opposition

“Poland won, democracy won,” declared Donald Tusk, the opposition leader, as he claimed victory in [Poland’s election](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/17/poland-shows-that-populists-can-be-beaten) last week. Not so fast. The president, Andrzej Duda, decides who gets the first shot at forming a government. On Tuesday Mr Duda, who is formally non-partisan but once belonged to the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party, will begin meeting party leaders to discuss their plans for government.

Both sides believe they have a[ mandate to rule](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/15/poland-gives-pro-european-liberals-a-big-win). PiS came first in the election, with 35.4% of the vote, but does not seem to be able to form a majority coalition in parliament. Mr Tusk’s alliance—which spans conservative and radical-left parties—has the numbers. It argues that giving the largest party priority, as is convention, would lead to meaningless negotiations and delay a handover of power, possibly by two months. In the meantime PiS could appoint more cronies to jobs in government and state-owned companies and erase evidence of misdemeanours. Mr Tusk has tasted victory, but may have to wait to savour it.

### NATO’s weapons plan

Whether Ukraine prevails over its Russian aggressor will depend on many factors. Few matter as much as the ability of the West’s defence companies to produce enough munitions. Ukraine needs artillery shells and air-defence missiles to stay in the fight. Its allies also need to replenish their [depleted arsenals](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/07/20/could-ukraines-allies-be-doing-more) of weapons.

At NATO’s summit in Vilnius in July the alliance launched its Defence Production Action Plan to ramp up capacity. On Tuesday the NATO-Industry Forum will meet in Stockholm to discuss progress. Attendees include industry executives and senior officials from NATO and from its member governments.

The picture is not reassuring. The industry is raising production where possible. (Lockheed-Martin, a defence contractor, is upping production of HIMARS rocket launchers, for instance.) But it is not yet getting from defence ministries the multi-year investment commitments that it needs to open the new manufacturing lines required to meet the demands of high-intensity warfare. For defence firms this is a show-us-the-money moment.
