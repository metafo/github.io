Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Thousands of Gazans begun evacuating after the **Israel Defence Forces** told some [1.1m Palestinians to relocate](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/13/as-war-looms-israel-calls-for-11m-people-to-evacuate-northern-gaza) from north to south **Gaza** within 24 hours, ahead of an expected ground invasion. The UN urged Israel to withdraw the “impossible” order; [Hamas](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-atrocities-and-israels-retaliation-will-change-both-sides-for-ever), who told Palestinians to ignore the warning, said 70 had been killed by airstrikes while trying to flee. Israel has deployed tanks on Gaza’s borders, as it targets underground tunnels used to hold supplies, fighters and possibly hostages. Hamas said that Israeli air strikes had killed 13 hostages held in Gaza over the past day.

House Republicans left for the weekend after choosing Jim Jordan, an Ohio conservative, as their [nominee for speaker](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/09/how-americas-house-of-representatives-will-choose-a-speaker) of the **American** House of Representatives. He beat Austin Scott, a Georgian congressman, but was 65 votes short of the 217 needed to win on the full House floor. On Thursday Steve Scalise, [the initial nominee](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/12/the-worst-job-in-washington-is-within-steve-scalises-grasp), dropped out due to a similar lack of support.

**Microsoft** closed a $75bn deal to buy **Activision Blizzard** after the tech giant’s [revised](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/13/britain-hands-microsofts-activision-deal-an-extra-life) bid for the video-game maker was approved by Britain’s anti-trust watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority. Microsoft will license cloud-streaming rights of Activision titles, such as *Call of Duty*, to Ubisoft, a French games publisher. This would prevent Microsoft from having a stranglehold on the market, the CMA said.

Two large American banks reported strong results in the third quarter, boosted by [higher interest rates](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/12/corporate-america-faces-a-trillion-dollar-debt-reckoning). **JPMorgan Chase**, America’s biggest [bank](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/19/americas-big-banks-are-in-rude-health-with-one-exception), saw a 35% increase in profits year-on-year and **Wells Fargo** reported a 61% surge. Separately, **BlackRock**, the world’s largest asset manager, beat expectations with a profit rise of 13% year on year, helped by the growth in technology services.

Repercussions from the Israel-Hamas war have been felt across **Europe**. On Friday a teacher was killed in an attack in France, believed to be linked to the conflict. Three Jewish schools closed in London over security fears, as did three others in Amsterdam. Britain and Belgium have stepped up security for Jewish communities, and in Germany, the government banned praise of Hamas’s crimes.

America’s top diplomat, **Antony Blinken**, thanked Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, for his attempts to calm the region when he met him in Jordan’s capital, Amman, as part of his tour of the [Middle East](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/09/hamass-carnage-upends-joe-bidens-plans-for-the-middle-east). On Thursday he was in Israel to show support. **Lloyd Austin**, America’s defence secretary, and **Ursula von der Leyen**, the president of the European Commission, followed suit on Friday.

A large flock of seagulls caused havoc after gathering on the runway at Marco Polo airport in Venice, **Italy**, forcing it to close for more than an hour. Several flights were delayed or redirected; one circled the airport for 25 minutes before being sent to Trieste instead. The birds were eventually shooed away with the use of a falconer and an “acoustic deterrent”.

### Israel’s emergency war cabinet

Hamas’s horrendous [terror attack](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/08/the-lessons-from-hamass-assault-on-israel) has prompted unity in a country that had been [divided for months](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/27/as-israel-turns-75-its-biggest-threats-now-come-from-within) by the judicial reforms of Binyamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government. On Wednesday Mr Netanyahu, the prime minister, agreed to form an emergency five-person [war cabinet](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/netanyahu-wages-war-and-fights-for-his-own-survival) with Benny Gantz, an opposition leader. A former defence minister and commander of Israel’s armed forces, Mr Gantz will give heft to a government that has few ministers with such experience.

Mr Netanyahu heeded demands to keep far-right partners out of the war cabinet. But Israel’s longest-serving prime minister has not kicked them out of his coalition. He will need their support to stay in power after the conflict ends.

Previous prime ministers have faced military debacles; they announced their resignations within two years of the wars’ end. Mr Netanyahu, on whose watch these terrible events unfolded, may face the same fate. Those who have joined his cabinet must compel him to focus on the security of the country—not on his political survival.

### America's military might

On September 30th American lawmakers passed a stopgap budget to fund the federal government for another 45 days. That averted a shutdown but deprived Ukraine of new military aid. With Israel now in need of military support, too, America finds itself with a [paralysed Congress](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/12/paralysis-in-congress-makes-america-a-dysfunctional-superpower) at a time of crisis.

So far, it has provided about $70bn in aid to Ukraine. It still has authority to send about $5bn worth of weapons from existing stocks, but only $1.6bn to replenish them. Soon Ukraine and Israel, and possibly Taiwan, will need more money from Congress. But that is unlikely to happen until the House of Representatives chooses [a new speaker](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/12/the-worst-job-in-washington-is-within-steve-scalises-grasp) to replace Kevin McCarthy. Republican infighting caused the party’s nominee, Steve Scalise, to pull out of the running on Thursday.

Some want to wrap Ukraine aid with help for Israel. If that works, the crisis in the Middle East may yet help Ukraine, rather than draw funds and attention away from it.

### Australia’s Voice referendum heads for defeat

Almost 18m Australians will vote in a referendum on Saturday to answer a question that has divided opinion for a generation: whether to acknowledge Australia’s first people in the constitution. The centre-left Labor government wants to enshrine an indigenous advisory body, or “Voice to Parliament”, within it. Aussies [look set to reject the idea](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/28/australians-looks-set-to-reject-new-provisions-for-aboriginal-people).

The Voice is envisaged as a way to patch up unhealed wounds from Australia’s colonisation by giving Aboriginal people more say in policymaking that concerns them. But no Australian referendum has yet passed without bipartisan support—and conservative parties have campaigned vociferously against this one.

They argue that the plan would codify racial divides in the constitution, increase bureaucracy and “open the door” for activists pushing for reparations. Opponents doubt that the Voice would improve the lives of indigenous Australians. Despite the government spending billions, suicides, incarcerations and the number of children in care remain disproportionately high. Sticking with the same old approach, however, is sure to change nothing.

### When cult cinema created a world of its own

The documentary’s title is self-explanatory: “Scala!!! Or, The Incredibly Strange Rise and Fall of the World’s Wildest Cinema and How It Influenced a Mixed-Up Generation of Weirdos and Misfits”. Its tone echoes the schlock-movie style so often on the programme at the Scala, a counter-cultural cinema in London’s then-scuzzy King’s Cross district, during its 1980s heyday. On Saturday the documentary has its British premiere at the BFI London film festival.

At a time of blockbuster franchises and streaming networks, “Scala!!!” records a bygone era in London and in film: the age of the cult movie. The Scala did for the city’s creative scene something akin to what the Velvet Underground did for rock bands: inspire a generation of artists. John Waters, an American filmmaker and the dean of cult cinema, calls it a “country club for criminals and lunatics and people that were high”. Cult-film buffs, mourning eccentric movies and eccentric places at which to watch them, will savour these recollections of a magnificently sleazy age.

### Weekend profile: Muhammed Deif, Hamas’s military chief

On October 7th Hamas, the militant group that rules [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/10/people-in-gaza-hate-the-night-all-they-can-see-are-explosions), launched a brutal attack against Israel, killing at least 1,300 people. Afterwards Hamas released a video, showing Muhammad Deif, their elusive military chief, speaking from the darkness. “In light of the continuing crimes against our people,” he said, “we have decided to put an end to all this.” Israel declared war shortly afterwards.

Deif was born as Muhammad Diab Ibrahim al-Masri in Khan Younis refugee camp, close to the Mediterranean coast, in the mid-1960s. The camp was mainly populated by [Palestinian refugees](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/13/as-war-looms-israel-calls-for-11m-people-to-evacuate-northern-gaza) who had fled during what they call the *nakba*, or “catastrophe”, of 1948, when 750,000 Palestinians were uprooted after the state of Israel was created. As a teenager he joined the Muslim Brotherhood, the world’s oldest Islamist group. He became increasingly active in the movement as a science student at the Islamic University in Gaza.

[Hamas](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/10/how-powerful-is-hamas), a Gazan spin-off of the Muslim Brotherhood, was founded in 1987. Deif joined that same year and rose up the ranks while learning to make bombs under Yayha Ayyash, a weapons-maker known as “the engineer”. By 2002 he was in charge of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing. During the second *intifada*, when thousands of Palestinians fought against Israel’s occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, he and his men carried out numerous terror attacks, killing dozens and injuring hundreds. Shimon Peres, then Israel’s prime minister, ordered Shin Bet, the security service, to kill him. But he proved difficult to find, and quickly became known as “Deif”, which means “guest” in Arabic, because he slept in a different place each night.

Since then he has lived in the shadows and survived several assassination attempts by Israel. He helped to develop makeshift rockets for Hamas, and masterminded a programme to dig a labyrinth of tunnels beneath Gaza. But he has not always emerged unscathed. Two strikes in the early 2000s left him seriously injured, and another in 2014 killed his wife and one of his children.

Some believe Deif is now hiding in the underground labyrinth he helped to create. But Israel says it is striking the tunnels ahead of a [possible ground invasion](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/brutal-urban-warfare-awaits-israels-army-in-gaza). The man known as “the cat with nine lives” may soon find his luck has run out.
