Almost all of **OpenAI’s** employees signed on to an open letter urging their board to resign, after it [sacked](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/18/what-sam-altmans-surprise-sacking-means-for-the-ai-race) the company’s boss, **Sam Altman**, on Friday. The letter’s organisers said that nearly 700 employees—out of 770—threatened to jump ship to Mr Altman’s newly established team at Microsoft (which is OpenAI’s biggest investor). Emmett Shear, former head of Twitch, a video-streaming service, will lead OpenAI in the interim.

**Joe Biden** said that he believes that Hamas and Israel are nearing a hostage-release deal. Under such an agreement, Hamas would return some of the hostages it is holding in Gaza, in exchange for Israel temporarily pausing its offensive. Earlier the enclave’s Hamas-run health ministry said 12 people were killed as **Israeli tanks** reportedly encircled the **Indonesian hospital** in northern Gaza.

**Argentina** elected **Javier Milei**, a self-proclaimed “anarcho-capitalist”, as its president. Mr Milei defeated Sergio Massa, the economy minister, [in a run-off](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/11/20/is-argentinas-new-president-too-divisive-to-fix-a-broken-economy), securing almost 56% of the vote with counting nearly complete. Inflation was a top concern for voters—the annual rate stood above 140% in October. Mr Milei campaigned on a radical economic platform that included scrapping the central bank and dollarising the economy.

A court in **America** ruled that only the federal government could bring challenges under an important provision of the **Voting Rights Act**—in effect, barring private lawsuits [alleging discrimination](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/08/the-supreme-court-says-alabamas-electoral-map-is-discriminatory) in election rules. It found that the plaintiffs (including the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP, a civil-rights group) had no right to sue Arkansas over a potentially discriminatory legislative map. The extraordinary decision will probably land before the Supreme Court.

**Lloyd Austin**, America’s defence secretary, said that his country’s support for Ukraine was “for the long haul” whilst on a surprise trip to Kyiv. Mr Austin’s visit comes amid concerns over [faltering American support](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/europe-needs-to-step-up-support-for-ukraine). Earlier, **Volodymyr Zelensky** dismissed the commander of **Ukraine’s** medical forces, Tetiana Ostashchenko. She had been accused by paramedics of not securing enough first-aid kits.

**Zambia’s** official creditors, co-led by China and France, stopped the country’s efforts to restructure $3bn of its debt. The group of 16 creditors claimed that Zambia’s IMF-approved deal with bondholders did not offer comparable debt-relief, but did not indicate the scale of additional concessions it required. Zambia has been in [protracted negotiations](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/29/new-forms-of-debt-restructuring-reward-bad-behaviour) following its default in 2020.

The **Guggenheim** appointed Mariët Westermann as its new director and chief executive, making her the first woman to lead New York’s famed arts hub. Ms Westermann has not worked as a museum director before. She is currently the vice chancellor of the Abu Dhabi campus of NYU, an American liberal arts college. The Guggenheim is set to [open a branch](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/11/20/the-travails-and-bold-aims-of-the-guggenheim-abu-dhabi) in Abu Dhabi in 2025.

### The Fed’s rate debate

Has the Federal Reserve finished raising interest rates? On Tuesday it will publish minutes from its latest meeting, which ended on November 1st. Investors and analysts will parse the words of officials. At that time the Fed refrained from raising rates in part because of a [surge in bond yields](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/04/a-surge-in-global-bond-yields-threatens-trouble). The minutes are likely to show that officials viewed these tighter financial conditions as doing its work for it.

But such an explanation will [raise as many questions](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/12/investors-should-treat-analysis-of-bond-yields-with-caution) as answers, because yields have declined by nearly half a percentage point since the meeting took place. Applying the same logic, the Fed may want to lean against this recent loosening of financial conditions by [raising rates again](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/02/markets-think-interest-rates-could-stay-high-for-a-decade-or-more). There are, however, other data points that will go into its calculus, most notably the surprising slowdown in inflation last month. The debate will carry on until mid-December, when the Fed next decides on rates.

### China’s Middle Eastern diplomacy

For over three decades America has been the Arab-Israeli conflict’s sole broker. But frustrated by America’s refusal to call for a ceasefire after five weeks of Israel’s war in Gaza, Muslim leaders are signalling that they have alternatives. On Tuesday Egyptian, Indonesian, Jordanian, Palestinian and Saudi officials are concluding diplomatic meetings in China, the first stop on a tour of foreign capitals. [China is keen to step up](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/10/26/how-china-sees-gaza). As they arrived in Beijing on Monday, their Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, called for an immediate ceasefire. “Israel should stop collective punishment of the people of Gaza,” he said.

China’s diplomatic forays into the Middle East yielded fruit earlier this year when it brokered a deal to normalise relations between two historic foes, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Resolving Israel’s 75-year-old conflict with the Palestinians will be harder. On Monday Israel’s ambassador to China said that attempts to press Israel on how it wages war were “politically motivated”. And Israel has made clear that it will not forgo America’s more sympathetic mediation.

### Nvidia’s near-monopoly under threat

During a tumultuous weekend which saw Sam Altman sacked from OpenAI, the world witnessed AI’s [“boomers” and “doomers](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/19/the-sam-altman-drama-points-to-a-deeper-split-in-the-tech-world)” wrestle for dominance. Another AI fight is unfolding in parallel: Nvidia, a chipmaker, will report its quarterly results on Tuesday. The company has a near-monopoly in AI semiconductors and its share price has jumped by over 200% since the beginning of the year. But pressure on its dominance is building.

For national security reasons America’s government has enacted increasingly stringent export controls on AI chips sold to China, which account for a fifth of Nvidia’s sales. The trade restrictions may be driving customers to find new suppliers. Baidu, a large Chinese tech firm, is reportedly buying more AI chips from Huawei, another Chinese firm, rather than Nvidia. At home, the American cloud computing giants—Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft—are increasingly trying to use AI chips designed in-house. Although Nvidia’s results may impress now, things can change quickly. Just ask Mr Altman.

### Will Chad be the next Sahelian country to fall?

On Tuesday the UN Security Council will discuss the Sahel. The arid strip south of the Sahara is far from secure. Since 2020 putschists have overthrown governments in [Burkina Faso](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/01/for-the-second-time-this-year-soldiers-stage-a-coup-in-burkina-faso), [Mali](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/05/25/the-leaders-of-malis-coup-last-august-do-it-again) and [Niger](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/28/nigers-putsch-is-bad-for-the-country-and-for-the-region), leading French soliders to leave the countries. Jihadist violence is rampant. Russia’s [Wagner group](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/08/31/wagner-routinely-targets-civilians-in-africa) of mercenaries is growing in influence.

Chad may descend into chaos next. Since his father was [killed by rebels](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/04/22/chads-strongman-president-idriss-deby-is-killed-by-rebels) in 2021, Mahamat Idriss Déby has ruled as an autocrat. But he is at risk of being ousted in a palace coup or perhaps even a rebel invasion. Mr Déby’s increasingly evident support for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)—a paramilitary force fighting the regular army in neighbouring [Sudan](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/16/a-genocidal-militia-is-winning-the-war-in-sudan), and which includes many Chadians—has divided Chad’s ruling elite, some of whom back the other side. Even if the RSF wins, factions could seek to settle scores in Chad. Upheaval in Chad could also put into question France’s long-cherished military bases in the country—and, as in the rest of the Sahel, open the door to greater Russian influence.

### Fargo’s comeback

The streaming wars have led Hollywood to endlessly plumb their archives for any franchise that might be remade or followed up. In 2023, NBC, Paramount+ and Netflix revived [television hits](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/27/a-golden-age-of-tv-is-losing-its-shine) from the 1980s and 1990s—including “Night Court”, “Frasier”, and “That ’70s Show”. They tried to update each show’s premises to meet modern sensibilities (unfortunately, canned laughter remains).

But perhaps the most surprising adaptation has been [“Fargo”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/17/the-economists-pick-of-the-best-television-shows-of-2023), which returns for a fifth season on Tuesday. Though the black comedy, written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen in 1996, won many awards, the tale has a definitive ending. But since spinning off into a series in 2014 (without either Coen’s involvement) the show has dazzled audiences with its inventive stories of “Minnesota Nice” crime in the Midwest.

After an underwhelming fourth season, the next instalment promises a comeback of unlikely drama—combining ancient magic and debt collection—and a punchy performance by Jon Hamm (of “Mad Men”) as an authoritarian sheriff.
