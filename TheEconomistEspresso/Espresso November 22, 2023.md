Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Binyamin Netanyahu, **Israel’s** prime minister, urged his government to back a proposed deal with **Hamas** to secure the release of some hostages. His call came after he presented the deal to his war cabinet and broader security cabinet. The terms reportedly include Israel agreeing to a five-day pause in its offensive in the Gaza Strip and releasing at least 150 Palestinian prisoners. In exchange Hamas would return 50 hostages. Earlier Qatar, which is brokering the deal along with America, said that talks over the deal were at a “critical and final stage”.

**Changpeng Zhao**, the [boss](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/19/will-binance-come-over-to-the-light-side) of the crypto firm **Binance**, pleaded guilty to federal money-laundering charges filed in Seattle, Washington. CZ, as he is known, will step down from his role and from the company altogether, and pay a $50m fine. The firm, now the world’s largest crypto exchange, also pleaded guilty and will pay a $4.3bn penalty.

**North Korea** fired what is suspected to be a [**spy satellite**](https://www.economist.com/why-is-north-korea-launching-rockets-again), in its third launch attempt this year (both previous attempts failed). If it stays up, the satellite would give the country the means to monitor the movements of American and South Korean troops. Japan, which had condemned the launch after being warned in advance, told citizens on Okinawa, a southern Japanese island, to shelter.

**Xi Jinping**, China’s president, called for an international peace conference to resolve the war between Israel and Hamas during an online meeting of the BRICS, an economic bloc. Leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa were joined by those from the group’s soon-to-be [new members](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/the-brics-are-expanding), including Iran and Saudi Arabia. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, accused Israel of actions “tantamount to genocide” in Gaza.

Police in **Costa Rica** arrested four people accused of making and selling **fentanyl**. The security minister said that the arrest, the first to be linked to the synthetic opioid that [kills](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/27/fentanyl-is-spreading-the-opioid-crisis-into-americas-big-cities) thousands of Americans each year, “confirms the presence of fentanyl” in the country. Nearby Honduras recently had its first-ever fentanyl bust, and further afield, Europe is [bracing](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/16/fentanyl-kills-thousands-every-year-in-america-will-europe-be-next) for the drug’s arrival.

**Germany** suspended new spending commitments, as the government grapples with a budgetary crisis caused by a [controversial court ruling](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/15/german-judges-toss-a-spanner-into-the-governments-spending-plans) last week. The judgment by the country’s highest court said that unspent government funds, originally earmarked for covid-19, could not be used for other purposes. Germany’s strict borrowing rules, the “debt brake”, leave the government with few other ways to raise funds.

**Britain’s** Supreme Court ruled that riders for Deliveroo, a food-delivery company, cannot be recognised as employees, in a landmark ruling for the gig economy. The court cited the riders’ ability to choose their own hours and delegate their orders to another person without Deliveroo’s involvement. In 2021 the court ruled that drivers for [Uber](https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/03/18/ubers-workers-benefit-from-a-supreme-court-decision), a ride-hailing company, were employees.

### Progress on an Israel-Hamas hostage deal

Israel’s government is shortly expected to approve an agreement with Hamas on the release of 50 [hostages](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/11/03/israels-top-hostage-negotiator-on-dealing-with-hamas) kidnapped by the militant group during its attack on October 7th.

In the deal, which was mainly brokered by the Qatari government, women and children are scheduled to be set free in tranches over several days. In exchange, Israel has agreed to release 150 Palestinian women and minors being held in Israeli prisons. Israel has also agreed to a temporary truce, to last four or five days, during which its troops will not advance or continue to attack Hamas’s military infrastructure inside the Gaza Strip.

Hamas took around 240 hostages from Israel to Gaza on October 7th. Some have been killed, released or rescued. The truce could be extended to release more of them. But Hamas, it appears, wants to keep many of them as bargaining chips for further deals.

### Another Kennedy shapes American politics

The assassination of John F. Kennedy, 60 years ago on Wednesday, changed America. As the years passed—and especially in the 1970s, as Americans grew increasingly disillusioned with their government—the tragedy spawned conspiracy theories about the president’s death. One proponent of a theory that the CIA helped kill JFK is Robert F. Kennedy junior, his nephew—and an independent candidate in the presidential election due in November 2024.

This Kennedy (the son of [Bobby](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/07/what-democrats-can-learn-from-bobby-kennedy), who was assassinated too, in 1968) also peddles more harmful theories, including that vaccines are dangerous. But a recent poll by Quinnipiac University found that 22% of voters would choose him over President Joe Biden and the more [conspiracy-friendly](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/18/part-of-donald-trumps-base-thinks-he-is-fighting-a-spiritual-war) Donald Trump. If he were to win that sort of share in the election, he would be the most successful third-party candidate in decades. (Ross Perot won 19% of the popular vote in 1992.) If he makes a dent in the votes of either main candidate, another Kennedy could yet leave his mark on America.

### Britain’s autumn statement

On Wednesday Britain’s chancellor will deliver his second budget of the year. In recent days Jeremy Hunt and Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, have been sounding more upbeat on the economy. According to them, inflation has been beaten and the economy has turned a corner. The talk now is of tax cuts ahead of a general election which must be held by January 2025.

The [Office for Budget Responsibility](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/11/10/the-obr-will-be-the-arbiter-of-britains-autumn-budget), which makes sure that the government is sticking to fiscal rules, is unlikely to be singing from the same hymn sheet. Its new forecasts, due just after Mr Hunt’s autumn statement, will make grim reading. The latest projections from the Bank of England suggest Britain’s economy will stagnate in 2024 and that, although inflation has peaked, it will linger uncomfortably high for longer than previously believed. Against that backdrop, modest tax cuts are unlikely to generate the sort of pre-election enthusiasm the chancellor is hoping for.

### The Dutch vote on life after Rutte

On Wednesday Dutch voters will cast ballots in a general election. It was called after [Mark Rutte](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/10/mark-rutte-the-dutch-prime-minister-quits-politics), the prime minister for the past 13 years, [submitted his resignation](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/13/farewell-mark-rutte-the-tiggerish-dutch-prime-minister) in July. The Dutch are in a rebellious mood: government scandals and the rising cost of living have damaged faith in politics.

Dutch politics are fragmented, with 26 parties running for parliament. One front-runner to form the next government is the New Social Contract, a new centre-right party launched by [Pieter Omtzigt](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/19/a-centre-right-maverick-pieter-omtzigt-could-win-the-dutch-election), a former Christian Democratic MP. Another is Mr Rutte’s centre-right Liberal party, which is holding its own under Dilan Yesilgoz, its new leader. A joint Labour-GreenLeft ticket is in the running, too.

But the latest polls also show an upswing for the far-right PVV party of [Geert Wilders](https://www.economist.com/europe/2017/03/18/geert-wilderss-anti-immigration-party-does-worse-than-expected-in-the-dutch-election). The elections could lead to a baggy centrist coalition like the previous one. Yet, should centre-right parties stop shunning Mr Wilders, the Netherlands could get one of its most right-wing governments ever.

### Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” ignites historical debate

Nearly 100 years ago “Napoléon”, a silent epic directed by Abel Gance, a French film-maker, championed his country’s former emperor in ambitious cinematic form. The movie, which covered Bonaparte’s early career, also revolutionised film-making, being widely praised for its scale and experimental photography. A new telling by Ridley Scott, an English director, released on Wednesday, has had a more complicated reception.

Sir Ridley’s less flattering Bonaparte, played by Joaquin Phoenix, has re-opened a debate over how a man both celebrated for his might and criticised for his expansionism should be remembered. Some Gallic reviewers have complained that the film is anti-French and inaccurate. Sir Ridley, who is best known for “Alien” and “[Gladiator](https://www.economist.com/moreover/2000/05/18/leather-skirts)”, has shrugged off such criticism. In interviews he has compared his subject to Adolf Hitler, dismissing historians who have called this interpretation absurd.

Still, Sir Ridley’s [“Napoleon”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/15/ridley-scotts-napoleon-cuts-the-emperor-down-to-size) is measured in both highlighting the imperial leader’s flaws and celebrating his achievements. Even if it does not wholly match up to Gance.
