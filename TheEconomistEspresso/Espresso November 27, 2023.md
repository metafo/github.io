### November 27, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Joe Biden**, America’s president, urged Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to extend a [four-day truce](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/22/israel-strikes-a-hostage-deal-but-promises-the-gaza-war-isnt-over) with Hamas to allow for the release of more hostages. A Hamas spokesman called on Mr Biden to press Israel to end its offensive. On Sunday **Hamas** handed over more [hostages](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/24/hamas-releases-24-hostages-including-13-israelis)—14 Israelis and three Thais—and Israel released a third batch of 39 Palestinian prisoners. The pause in fighting has allowed supplies of food, fuel and medicine to enter Gaza.

Israeli forces killed eight Palestinians in the occupied **West Bank**. The largest raid took place overnight in the city of Jenin, which is seen as a militant stronghold. The Israeli army said it was seeking to capture suspects involved in an attack on Israelis in August. Local health officials estimate that 239 Palestinians have been killed in the [West Bank](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/06/settlers-are-causing-mayhem-in-the-west-bank) in near-daily violence since October 7th.

Nearly 100 people died as a result of **flooding in Somalia**, according to the country’s news agency. The government estimates that around 700,000 people have been displaced. Since October the [Horn of Africa](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/01/every-year-heavy-rain-brings-misery-and-gridlock-to-west-africa) has been battered by torrential rain linked to the [El Niño](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/08/31/what-is-el-nino) weather phenomenon. The UN has described Somalia’s floods as the worst in decades; more rain is expected from Tuesday.

**Geert Wilders** vowed to eventually become prime minister of the **Netherlands** on X (formerly Twitter), following the[ surprise victory](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/23/geert-wilderss-election-win-leaves-the-dutch-in-an-awful-quandary) for his anti-Muslim, anti-immigration, anti-EU Party for Freedom in elections on Wednesday. The PVV is forecast to take just 25% of parliamentary seats, meaning it needs to co-operate with two moderate parties to form a government. On Friday the centre-right VVD, which leads the current government, said it would not go into coalition with the PVV.

**Sierra Leone** imposed a nationwide curfew after an attack on military barracks and an outbreak of armed fighting in the capital, Freetown. The country’s president, [Julius Maada Bio](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/06/29/sierra-leones-president-is-re-elected-in-the-first-round), said “calm has been restored”. Witnesses reported heavy gunfire in the districts of Wilberforce and Murray Town on Sunday morning. Sierra Leone has endured months of [violence](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/19/how-liberia-and-sierra-leone-ended-their-cycles-of-violence) since an election in June.

**China** and **America** traded accusations after China’s army said it had to “warn away” an American warship in the disputed [South China Sea](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-us-destroyer-entered-its-territorial-waters-without-permission-2023-11-25/). America said the ship had “asserted navigational rights… consistent with international law”. China claims almost all of the South China Sea, despite an arbitral tribunal at The Hague ruling it had no basis in law in 2016.

“Prophet Song”, by Paul Lynch, won the **Booker prize** for the best novel of the past year written in English. Mr Lynch has said that his book, set in an Ireland sliding into authoritarianism, was inspired by “modern chaos”, particularly the “implosion” of Syria. Its protagonist, Eilish Stack, must protect her family when her husband attracts the interest of the secret police.

### Europe’s southern energy powerhouse

The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), an intergovernmental group that includes the 27 EU member states and 16 Mediterranean partner countries, will hold its annual summit on Monday in Barcelona. While the brutal war in Gaza will dominate the discussions, another topic will brighten the mood: the Mediterranean as Europe’s [future southern powerhouse](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/13/can-the-mediterranean-become-europes-energy-powerhouse) and hub of a hydrogen economy.

The region enjoys a lot of sunshine and, in some places, strong winds—ideal conditions to generate renewable power. The idea is that countries use it for their own energy needs, but also turn it into hydrogen, which can then be taken up north to help decarbonise Europe’s heavy industry. As with most alluring plans, hurdles are high: pipelines have to be built, offtake deals signed and political risk reduced. More such summits will come and go before the Med becomes synonymous with not just tourism, but also hydrogen.

### Brazil struggles to win back investors

South America’s largest economy is a tricky destination for capital. Investors, previously wary that the re-elected president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, would repeat his party’s spending spree of a decade ago that [ended in tears](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2015/02/28/the-crash-of-a-titan), had been [calmed](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/26/as-lula-takes-over-brazils-economic-prospects-are-looking-up) by promises of a new fiscal framework and tax reform. But in October Lula said the government would “hardly” meet the fiscal target proposed by its [efficient new finance minister](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/08/02/investors-are-increasingly-optimistic-about-brazils-economy), Fernando Haddad. And Brazil’s economy is winding down—GDP growth dropped to 0.9% in the second quarter, from 1.9% in the first.

Those concerns will be reflected by foreign direct investment data for October, due on Monday. Between January and September Brazil received the least FDI since 2020, in a 40% drop from the same period in 2022. Economists expect the latest forecast to show $65bn for 2023—well short of the $90.5bn in 2022, a ten-year record aided by high commodity prices.

### Postscript for Poland’s PiS party

Mondays are never easy. But few people will dread heading to work as much as Mateusz Morawiecki, [Poland’s](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/06/15/what-to-read-to-understand-modern-poland) caretaker prime minister, who must meet the constitutional deadline to propose a new government. Not many are keen to man the sinking ship—his prospective cabinet will almost certainly fail to win a vote of confidence in parliament in the next fortnight.

Mr Morawiecki’s Law and Justice (PiS) party came first in an [election in mid-October](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/17/poland-shows-that-populists-can-be-beaten) with 35.4% of the vote. As is customary, the president, Andrzej Duda, who hails from PiS, granted the leading party first shot at forming a government. That has delayed the opposition’s coalition, which holds 248 of 460 seats in the more powerful lower chamber of parliament. It will have the opportunity to [take back power](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/15/poland-gives-pro-european-liberals-a-big-win) only after Mr Morawiecki fails and the president formally passes on the initiative—probably on December 13th, nearly two months after the election. After an eight-year wait, every additional day seems long.

### Russia fends off Western decadence

On Monday the “World Russian People’s Council” begins its 25th annual summit in Moscow. The organisation, which is led by Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, champions conservative ideas about family, religion and patriotism. This year’s summit focuses on *Russkiy mir* or the “Russian World”, a [previously obscure historical term](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/03/26/the-new-russian-cult-of-war) which has come to represent a mixture of anti-Western dogma, nationalism and conspiracy theory.

The invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the Kremlin’s turn toward social conservatism. This month the justice ministry filed a motion in Russia’s highest court to label the “international public LGBT movement” an “extremist” organisation. That could make supporting gay rights a criminal offence in the country. And *Nezavisimaya Gazeta*, a Russian newspaper, reported that lawmakers were considering a ban on abortions in private clinics, ostensibly to stave off [demographic crisis](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/03/04/russias-population-nightmare-is-going-to-get-even-worse). As the war drags on, the Kremlin’s conservative fervour only grows greater.

### Rap lyrics go on trial in Atlanta

“I never killed anybody but I got something to do with that body,” raps Jeffrey Williams, an artist from Atlanta better known as [Young Thug](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/02/23/at-young-thugs-blockbuster-trial-rap-lyrics-are-used-as-evidence), on a song from 2018. Such lines could soon come back to haunt him. Prosecutors allege that Mr Williams’s record label, Young Stoner Life (YSL), is a violent gang. Young Thug and five other YSL members will stand trial from Monday on several charges, including in some cases murder and armed robbery. They deny wrongdoing.

Mr Williams is the most prominent rapper whose lyrics are being used as evidence against him, but he is far from the first. The practice of using rap lyrics in trials is increasingly common and controversial. Mr Williams’s lawyers argue that his songs should not be admitted as evidence because they express the thoughts of a fake persona. Prosecutors are curtailing speech and targeting a black art form, Mr Williams’s defenders contend. But speech, prosecutors might retort, can be evidence.
