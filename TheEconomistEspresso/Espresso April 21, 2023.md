Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

After a two-day delay, **SpaceX** launched its Starship system—with a spaceship atop the most powerful rocket ever built—from the Gulf Coast of Texas. Starship successfully took off from the launch pad but, at around 40km up, the booster and spaceship failed to separate from each other. The craft then experienced what [the company](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/02/19/spacexs-monstrous-dirt-cheap-starship-may-transform-space-travel) called “rapid, unscheduled disassembly” (it was blown up).

The UN’s refugee agency said between 10,000 and 20,000 people have fled the [fighting](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/20/sudan-is-sliding-towards-civil-war) in **Sudan** for neighbouring Chad. At least 300 civilians have been killed and 2,600 injured in the six days of conflict. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan’s military commander and de facto leader, said there was “no room for talks” with the Rapid Support Forces, an opposition militia.

**Jens Stoltenberg**, NATO’s secretary-general, said Ukraine’s “rightful place” was in the alliance and that its application would be discussed at a summit in July. In his first visit to Ukraine since Russia invaded the country, Mr Stoltenberg met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and paid his respects to fallen Ukrainian soldiers*.* Meanwhile Denmark and the Netherlands said they would donate 14 [Leopard 2 tanks](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/01/25/what-makes-germanys-leopard-2-tank-the-best-fit-for-ukraine) to Ukraine.

**Blackstone** reported first-quarter profits of $1.25bn, a drop of 36% year-on-year. The American private-equity giant blamed commercial property’s [weakening outlook](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/03/29/commercial-property-losses-will-add-to-banks-woes) and a slowdown in dealmaking for the results. The firm took in $40bn in new capital, a 5% fall compared with the previous quarter, and reached $991bn in assets under management—it had hoped to hit $1trn by the end of 2022.

**BuzzFeed** is closing its news operation and sacking about 15% of its workforce, according to a memo sent to staff. The [digital-media firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2014/08/16/which-media-company-are-you), founded in 2011, won a Pulitzer prize in 2021 for its journalism. But profits have proved elusive. Vice Media and Vox Media, similarly disruptive firms launched shortly after BuzzFeed, also face funding challenges.

**Renault** said it would not follow Tesla in cutting prices for its [electric vehicles](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/04/14/an-electric-shock). The French carmaker is facing price pressure from its American competitor, which has reduced the cost of its EVs six times in America this year. Investors are concerned that continued discounts for EVs will hit profit margins. Despite announcing better-than-expected first-quarter revenues on Thursday, Renault shares fell by about 8% in morning trading.

Officials in **Florida** apologised for sending a screeching emergency alert for no reason to many residents’ phones at 4:45am. “This is a TEST of the Emergency Alert System. No action required”, read an accompanying message. “We know a 4:45am wake up call isn’t ideal”, the disaster-response department later wrote, understatedly, on Twitter.

### Horror and hope in Yemen

This weekend is the Eid al-Fitr holiday which marks the end of Ramadan. Festivities in Yemen will be muted by a stampede in Sana’a, the capital, on Wednesday: at least 78 people were killed in a crush to collect donations.

Before the tragedy, however, the country had seemed somewhat hopeful. [Almost 900 former prisoners](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/20/a-prisoner-swap-is-a-symbolic-step-towards-ending-the-saudi-led-war-in-yemen) will celebrate Eid at home, having been freed as part of a detainee swap between the Houthis, a Shia militia that controls much of the country, and their Saudi-led foes. The exchange suggests both sides want to end their eight-year war.

After the holiday, negotiators will try to hash out a deal. The Houthis want the Saudi-backed government of Yemen to pay the salaries of civil servants in areas they control, among other demands. The Saudis, eager to exit the war, are willing to make concessions. But sadly even the departure of the Saudis would not end a longer conflict over how to share power in the fractious state.

### The West assesses damage from the Pentagon leaks

On Friday Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, must confront his country’s discomfited allies for the first time since top-secret Pentagon documents were[ leaked](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/13/america-arrests-the-suspect-behind-mass-intelligence-leaks) on social media. The “Ramstein group”, named for the American air-force base in Germany where they will meet, includes officials from the 50-odd countries that arm Ukraine. In private they will want reassurances that America is acting to prevent future breaches. In public they will signal determination not to let the fiasco divert them from supporting Ukraine.

They would do well to carry a copy of one leaked page: a slide marked NOFORN (Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals) summarising Ukraine’s acute shortage of air-defence missiles. Drawn up in February, it predicted that Ukraine would run out of medium-range air-defence missiles in May. That could allow Russia to use its powerful air force to foil Ukraine’s looming counter-attack. Ukraine’s backers will argue that now is the time to scour Western armouries for precious missiles—and to start giving Ukraine advanced fighter jets.

### P&G is pinched and gloomy

Procter & Gamble, one of the world’s biggest consumer-goods companies, reports its earnings on Friday. The figures will give a sign of how companies are navigating stubborn inflation and rising interest rates. Higher prices annoy consumers, but for some businesses steady inflation can be a quiet blessing: when matched with falling input costs, it can yield fatter profits on lower volumes.

P&G, which makes Pampers diapers, Tide laundry detergent, Gillette razors and other premium home brands has been struggling with higher outlays and freight costs. P&G also had a disappointing previous quarter, as inflation-driven price increases failed to offset declining volumes. [Customers](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/14/how-americans-feel-about-the-economy), feeling the pinch, may have been “trading down” to discount brands. Similar results this time will send an ominous signal about consumer confidence. Combined with troubling signs from the property market, they may, yet again, suggest a looming recession.

### The sorry state of the climate

On Friday the World Meteorological Organisation will publish the “State of the Global Climate” for 2022, one of its annual assessments of the impacts of global warming. The contents—unsurprisingly—will not be positive. Provisional estimates from the WMO have already suggested that the past eight years were the warmest on record for the globe as a whole. This was confirmed by Copernicus, the EU’s Earth-observation programme, in its own analysis, first published in January.

Within those eight years 2022 itself was among the coolest, with temperatures partially suppressed by La Niña, a [global weather pattern](https://www.economist.com/interactive/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-weather-system-that-influences-the-world). Even so, 2022 saw record-breaking heat across America, Asia and Europe. Catastrophic flooding in Pakistan affected some 33m people; a series of tropical storms battered countries in south-east Africa. All these [extreme weather events](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/08/extreme-weather-events-are-getting-more-frequent), which impacted millions of people and cost billions of dollars, were worsened, to some degree, by climate change. And further warming is now [inevitable](https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/11/05/the-world-is-going-to-miss-the-totemic-1-5c-climate-target), meaning that even more lives and money will be lost in the years to come.

### Everything But the Girl offer softness and spikes

It’s not like Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt have been idle in the 24 years since “Temperamental”, their last album as the English musical duo Everything But the Girl. Both have made several successful solo records, and Ms Thorn has written four acclaimed books. They got married—their accountant’s idea, Mr Watt claims—and raised three children together. Still, there’s something right about their recording as a pair again, the result of which is released on Friday.

“Fuse”, Everything But the Girl’s 11th album, is stark and yet soft. Ms Thorn’s voice is warm and comforting while Mr Watt’s accompaniments, usually electronic, are imaginative without being obtrusive. The mood is encapsulated in “Lost”, a track about the death of Ms Thorn’s mother, which opens: “I lost my mind today.” The raw pain of the lyric is contrasted with a song as pretty as a narcissus. Adventurous yet familiar, “Fuse” is the rare comeback album that might be better than its predecessors.
