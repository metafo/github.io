## The world in brief

### December 26, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

After a brief visit to Gaza **Binyamin Netanyahu**, Israel’s prime minister, told colleagues in his Likud party that the fighting in the territory was “not close to ending”. “Military pressure” was vital to obtain the release of more than 100 hostages still held by Hamas, he told the Israeli parliament. Earlier, Palestinian authorities said that at least 100 people had been killed by Israeli air strikes overnight, more than 70 of them in a refugee camp in central **Gaza**. Israel said that it was reviewing the claim. An Israeli air strike in Syria killed Sayyed Razi Mousavi, a senior commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, according to an Iranian news agency.

The whereabouts of **Alexei Navalny**, which had been a worrying mystery to many of his supporters, are now known, according to a spokeswoman. Lawyers for Russia’s most important opposition leader, sentenced to 30 years in jail on various trumped-up charges, had been [trying to locate him](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/14/alexei-navalny-russias-opposition-leader-is-missing-in-the-gulag) since learning on December 11th that he was no longer in a penal colony to the east of Moscow. He is now in another such facility in the Arctic, 1,900km to the capital’s north-east.

Students in **Belgrade**, Serbia’s capital, blocked major roads to protest against the result of a parliamentary election held last weekend, which they consider to be fraudulent. The Serbian Progressive Party of President Aleksandar Vucic claims that it won. On Sunday demonstrators had tried to storm the city hall, and were met by riot police firing tear gas. The road blockade raises fears that the clashes will continue.

The Turkish air force killed 26 **Kurdish militants** in air strikes in northern Iraq and Syria. On Sunday 30 militants were killed. Turkey’s attacks are a response to the killing of 12 Turkish soldiers in Iraq on Friday and Saturday by the [Kurdistan Workers’ Party](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/06/28/what-is-the-pkk), an armed Kurdish group. Fighting between Turkey and the PKK, which demands extensive autonomy for the region’s 30m Kurds, has recently spread from south-eastern Turkey and the mountains of northern Iraq into Syria.

**Ukraine’s Orthodox Christians** celebrated Christmas officially on December 25th for the first time in a century. The change is the result of a decision by Ukraine’s government to shift to the Gregorian calendar from the Julian calendar, which marks January 7th as Christmas Day. The shift, decided upon last July, is a part of a policy to separate Ukraine’s institutions from those of Russia, including the Russian Orthodox Church.

The **pope** concentrated on war in his Christmas Day message, in particular the one between Israel and Hamas. He condemned the weapons industry and its “instruments of death” and noted that Bethlehem was “a place of sorrow and silence” this year. In Britain **King Charles III** spoke warmly about charity work in his second Christmas broadcast. In the speech, which continued a royal tradition dating back nine decades, he called Britain’s volunteers the “essential backbone of our society”.

### 2024 in preview: America’s looming unpopularity contest

*This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape the United States and the Americas?*

In America’s 2024 presidential campaign, all signs point towards a rematch of two old-timers: Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Each will attempt to persuade voters that the other is unfit to serve. Mr Biden will argue that his predecessor is an existential threat to the republic. Mr Trump, unashamed by the attempted insurrection on January 6th 2021 or the many related criminal indictments he is fighting, will argue that it is the current president who is the threat, and that he is too old to deal with America’s problems. Supporters of Mr Biden hope that Mr Trump manages to defeat himself.

American voters are burnt out. In September 65% of respondents told the Pew Research Centre that they were always or often exhausted by their country’s politics; 55% said they were typically driven to anger. The election’s outcome cannot be known one year out. But the campaign seems sure to produce even greater malaise.

### 2024 in preview: Global crises test American power

Can America sustain its role as the arsenal of democracy in 2024? It could prove challenging. “America-first” Republicans have hampered normal budgeting and resisted funding the war in Ukraine. If they manage to cut off aid, allies everywhere will shudder—even more if their champion, Donald Trump, is re-elected president.

One test will be in the Indo-Pacific. America’s investments in military equipment there will not fully bear fruit until the 2030s. Yet Xi Jinping, China’s leader, wants his army to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027. This gap, and the changing balance of power in the region, places a premium on America’s network of alliances. Mr Biden has worked to repair the damage that Mr Trump inflicted on it. He is also weaving a “latticework” of ad hoc partnerships, such as the AUKUS deal with Britain to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. Expect America to add more such strands in 2024, some of which do not require approval from a chaotic Congress.

### 2024 in preview: Latin America’s messy politics

In 2024 Latin America’s pattern of shifting political power between left and right may be disrupted. The region has switched between ideologies for decades. A “pink tide” of left-wing governments rose in the early 2000s, followed in the 2010s by a “blue tide” of right-wing leaders, such as Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. By 2023 it seemed that another era of progressive politics had begun: 12 of 19 countries were run by left-wing governments.

But the left’s dominance is already under threat. In November Argentina elected Javier Milei, the region’s first avowedly libertarian president. Elsewhere left-wing governments have weakened mandates. Chile’s Gabriel Boric, a social democrat, has seen his approval ratings drop because of [rising crime](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/11/02/gang-violence-is-spreading-across-latin-america) and a worsening economy. Some think Gustavo Petro of Colombia, whose leftist reforms have been largely stymied, may not last his full term. And Claudia Sheinbaum—[if she wins](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/mexico-will-elect-its-first-female-president) Mexico’s presidential election in June—is unlikely to have the congressional supermajority that bolstered her predecessor. She and others on the left may have to compromise.

### 2024 in preview: A sunny future for Latin America’s startups

Startups have been a bright spot for Latin America in recent years. The number backed by venture capital more than doubled between 2020 and 2023 to more than 2,500, according to LAVCA, an investor association. Startup activity exploded during the pandemic. Since then it has calmed down. But the number of startups will increase in 2024. More will find backing from Latin American venture-capital funds, which are now proliferating.

Many of the firms seek to relieve the region’s particular “pain points”. Logistics is one active area: postal services are shoddy and slow. Startups are likely to expand into business-to-business deliveries, especially if Mexico attracts more manufacturers seeking to move operations from China. Another problem to be solved is low trust. Kavak, an online platform based in Mexico, functions as a middleman for people buying and selling second-hand cars. Brazil—the most established startup hub—along with Mexico and Colombia have already produced unicorns (companies valued at more than $1bn). Other countries may join them.
