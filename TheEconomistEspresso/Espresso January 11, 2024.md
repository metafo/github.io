## The world in brief

### January 11, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



Antony Blinken, **America’s** secretary of state, said that “there will be consequences” if [the Houthis](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/12/who-are-the-houthis-the-group-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea), an Iran-backed militant group, continue their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. Mr Blinken said that the Yemeni group presents “a clear threat to the interests of countries around the world”, after American and British forces shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the group. The Houthis have ramped up [attacks](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/01/09/as-houthi-missiles-block-the-suez-drought-depletes-the-panama-canal) on commercial vessels in retaliation for Israel’s war in Gaza, forcing many shipping lines to re-route.

**Al-Shabab** seized a **United Nations** helicopter that landed in an area the terrorist group controls in **Somalia**. According to media reports, the plane was carrying nine passengers, both Somalis and foreigners: six were captured, one was killed, and two escaped. The UN provides support to the African Union’s [peacekeeping troop](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/02/the-drawdown-of-african-peacekeepers-from-somalia-has-stalled)s in Somalia; the helicopter was meant to be transporting injured soldiers.

**Chris Christie**, the Republican presidential challenger running the most explicitly anti-Trump campaign, dropped out of the primary. Mr Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, made the announcement at an event in New Hampshire. He had bet big on the state, where independent voters, not just registered Republicans, can cast ballots. But conservatives eschewing Mr Trump [seem to prefer](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-republican-primaries-tracker) Nikki Haley.

America’s **Securities and Exchange Commission** approved the first **bitcoin** exchange-traded funds, just one day after its official X account made an “unauthorised” post announcing the move in an apparent hack. The ETFs are expected to bring fresh interest to the [embattled cryptocurrency industry](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/10/19/with-sam-bankman-fried-in-the-dock-does-crypto-have-a-future). However the SEC has long been sceptical of [bitcoin](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/18/why-bitcoin-is-up-by-almost-150-this-year) and said that “investors should remain cautious”.

Storms in **America** killed at least four people as they brought snow, strong winds and floods to the east coast. Power was cut off for half a million homes and more than a thousand flights were grounded due to extreme weather. One of the worst-affected states is Florida, where the governor, Ron DeSantis, declared an emergency in 49 counties on Tuesday.

Narendra Modi, **India’s** prime minister, kicked off an **investment conference** in his home state. The biennial Vibrant Gujarat Investment Summit is being attended by executives from India and the rest of the world, who have pledged huge investments in the state. Business leaders will be keen to gain favour with Mr Modi, whose Bharatiya Janata Party is [likely to win](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/12/03/narendra-modis-party-sweeps-in-north-and-central-india) elections this year.

As part of a campaign against corruption, **China** sharpened its focus on officials’ business dinners. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said it will punish those who break guidelines for eating and drinking, including by pushing junior staff to pay for meals. Xi Jinping, China’s president, has promised to show “no mercy” in his [crackdown on graft](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/09/14/chinas-government-launches-a-campaign-against-medical-corruption).

### Israel accused of genocide

On Thursday the UN’s International Court of Justice will hear a case brought by South Africa that accuses Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. South Africa and Israel are both signatories to the [Genocide Convention](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/10/how-the-term-genocide-is-misused-in-the-israel-hamas-war) of 1948. That obliges them to prevent and punish genocide—defined as acts committed “with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”.

South Africa argues that the killing of civilians in Gaza (more than 23,000 people, mostly civilians, have died, according to the Hamas-run health ministry), together with forced evacuations and [isolation](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/04/war-hunger-and-disease-stalk-gazas-22m-people) of the territory, qualifies as genocide. The 84-page filing argues that Israel is inflicting such appalling “conditions of life” on Gazans that they are “calculated to bring about their physical destruction”. Israel gets to reply on Friday. It will probably argue that it is waging war in Gaza to defend itself against the terrorist group Hamas, not to “destroy” the people who live there.

### Poland’s new opposition

In recent years Poles have repeatedly been asked to march in defence of democracy. A big rally on Thursday in Warsaw, the capital, is the first to be called by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, which lost power in December. Since then PiS has railed against the [new liberal government](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/14/donald-tusk-must-undo-years-of-populist-subversion-in-poland) led by Donald Tusk. It found the dismissal of PiS loyalists from public television and radio posts particularly grating.

The conflict is escalating. On Tuesday police detained two former PiS ministers who had been convicted of abuse of power. They were holed up in the presidential palace. Andrzej Duda, the president and an ally of PiS, maintains that he had pardoned them. (He did, but a Polish court overturned his decision.) The government accuses Mr Duda of obstructing justice. Amid this legal chaos, parliament has postponed its first sitting this year; on Wednesday one of the detained politicians began a hunger strike in prison. PiS seems as heavy-handed in opposition as it was [in power](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/17/poland-shows-that-populists-can-be-beaten).

### Clearing the Black Sea of mines

At a ceremony in Istanbul on Thursday, officials from Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey will sign an agreement to clear mines floating in the [Black Sea](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/05/the-war-in-ukraine-is-threatening-to-wash-across-the-black-sea) as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The deal, which follows months of talks, will see ships from all three countries patrolling the waters off their coasts for stray explosives. For nearly two years, commercial shipping and fishing in the Black Sea has suffered as a result of Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian ports. Mines are compounding the risk.

Britain had agreed to provide Ukraine with two of its own mine-hunters to protect shipping lanes. But Turkey scuppered the deal—saying that it would not allow the ships to transit its waters, citing an international treaty. Turkey insists on keeping other NATO forces out of the Black Sea, fearing a shooting war with Russia off its shores, and prefers to co-operate with littoral states, including Bulgaria and Romania, instead.

### America’s inflation watch

On Thursday America will release its consumer-price index for December. This measure of American inflation is the most closely watched economic indicator in the world. Investors are counting on a continued decline towards the Fed’s target for annual inflation of roughly 2%. This would give the central bank space to cut interest rates.

Most economists think that “core” inflation (which strips out food and energy costs) fell from 4% in November to 3.8% in December. That is well down from a high of nearly 7% in late 2022. But the details may be a little [less encouraging](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/03/has-america-really-escaped-inflation). Although goods prices have been declining, prices for services, including travel and housing rents, have continued to rise at a relatively fast rate. In the coming months that could keep inflation higher than the Fed would like. Investors may be disappointed.

### Afghan batsmen hit the big time

Australia [lifted](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/10/india-are-dominating-the-cricket-world-cup-will-they-choke) the Cricket World Cup trophy in India six weeks ago. For many, though, the real winners were Afghanistan. The poorest, least fancied team in the competition beat England, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Netherlands to come tantalisingly close to the semi-finals. Their under-dog story turned the world’s attention to the Afghan men’s cricket team, which has been steadily improving for years.

The team’s first big assignment of 2024 is a three-match Twenty20 tour of India. The initial match will take place in Mohali on Thursday. India’s dominance of the cricket economy means that fixtures against its teams are the most sought-after in the world. The hosts are very likely to win, but Afghanistan’s invitation shows recognition of the team’s success. Their next step will be to perform as strongly in matches in England or Australasia, where the faster pitches will provide a different test for the Afghan batsmen.
