Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Armenia said that over 50,000 ethnic **Armenians** had fled from **Nagorno-Karabakh** into the country since [Azerbaijan](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/21/azerbaijan-is-close-to-taking-control-of-nagorno-karabakh) took control of the enclave last week. The figure represents over one-third of Nagorno-Karabakh’s population. Azerbaijan arrested [Ruben Vardanyan](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/12/the-armenians-of-nagorno-karabakh-have-been-blockaded-by-azerbaijan), who led the enclave’s separatist government until February, as he tried to flee into Armenia. Azerbaijan said 192 of its troops had been killed during the military operation to regain full control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which had been run by Armenian separatists for three decades.

**Travis King,** an American soldier who crossed into North Korea in July, was transferred into American custody after being expelled from the country. Earlier North Korea said it had completed its investigation into Mr King’s illegal entry. He [fled ](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/07/19/an-american-soldier-has-deserted-to-north-korea)there after he was held for almost two months in a South Korean prison for assault.

**Germany** announced tighter controls on its borders with **Poland** and the **Czech Republic**, including “flexible spot checks” on those entering the country. The Social Democrats, who head Germany’s ruling coalition, have been under growing pressure to act over an influx of asylum applications ahead of regional elections next month. They have fallen behind [the Alternative for Germany](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/13/support-for-the-hard-right-afd-is-surging-in-germany), a far-right anti-immigration party, in the polls.

Hui Ka Yan, the chairman of **Evergrande**, a beleaguered Chinese property company, has been placed under police surveillance, according to Bloomberg. Mr Hui was reportedly summoned by Chinese authorities earlier this month and told that he may not leave his current location without their approval. [Evergrande](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/16/how-bad-could-chinas-property-crisis-get) filed for bankruptcy in America in August and is facing the threat of liquidation.

**Britain’s** oil and gas regulator approved the development of the country’s largest untapped oil field. Rishi Sunak, the country’s prime minister, recently committed to issuing over 100 new licences for drilling in the North Sea, which he said would increase the country’s energy security and benefit its economy. Last week Mr Sunak [watered down](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/05/britain-is-losing-its-way-in-cutting-carbon) his government’s net-zero strategy.

**Bob Menendez**, a Democratic senator from **New Jersey**, pleaded not guilty to [corruption charges](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/22/bob-menendez-a-prominent-senator-faces-bribery-charges) which were brought against him last week. Mr Menendez is accused of allegedly sharing sensitive information with Egyptian officials, among other things. On Friday, he stepped down as chair of the Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee—as required by Senate Democrats’ rules—but has said he will not resign.

**Kia** and **Hyundai**, [two South Korean carmakers](https://www.economist.com/cities-are-suing-car-manufacturers-over-auto-theft-they-have-a-case), recalled nearly 3.4m cars in America. The firms cited a risk of engine fires and told owners to park their cars outdoors. The anti-lock system may leak brake fluid, which can cause an electrical short and start a fire. Owners have reported at least 53 burning and melting incidents to the two companies.

### Testing times for India and America

On Thursday Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, will host [Subrahmanyam Jaishankar,](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/15/in-conversation-with-subrahmanyam-jaishankar) India’s foreign minister, in Washington. The meeting comes at a [delicate time](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/25/india-is-testing-americas-friendship). Last week Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, accused India of involvement in the [murder](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/19/a-devastating-accusation-by-justin-trudeau-against-india) of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh leader in Canada. India furiously denied the allegation and in turn accused Canada of sheltering [separatists](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/19/what-is-khalistan-the-independent-homeland-some-sikhs-yearn-for).

The claim put Canada’s Western allies in a bind. They have been courting India as a [bulwark](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/15/on-defence-america-and-india-edge-closer-together) against China. Yet American intelligence appears to have contributed to Canada’s assessment that India had participated in the killing.

President Joe Biden reportedly raised the issue with Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, at the G20 meeting in Delhi this month. On Tuesday Mr Jaishankar [reiterated](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/told-canada-it-is-not-government-policy-jaishankar-on-nijjar-killing/article67350744.ece) that it was “not India’s policy” to kill people abroad, but said that the government was open to looking at concrete evidence of its involvement if presented with it. He is unlikely to offer more. His conversation with Mr Blinken will have awkward moments.

### The House investigates Biden

On Thursday the Oversight Committee of America’s House of Representatives will hold its first hearing into the supposed corruption of President Joe Biden since Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker, announced impeachment proceedings on September 12th. Three witnesses will testify: an expert in constitutional law; a forensic accountant; and a former assistant attorney-general. None has direct knowledge of any evidence against Mr Biden. They will offer testimony on the hypothetical case for impeachment.

Republicans claim that as vice-president Mr Biden profited from his son [Hunter Biden’s](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/12/13/what-are-the-allegations-against-hunter-biden) work for Burisma, a Ukrainian oil-and-gas company, and that Mr Biden engineered the dismissal of Ukraine’s chief prosecutor to stop an investigation into Hunter. Investigations have turned up [no evidence](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/28/house-republicans-are-no-closer-to-tying-hunter-bidens-activities-to-joe) of this. Ukraine’s former president, Petro Poroshenko, has dismissed the accusations. But the congressional hearings will present [details](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/11/hunter-bidens-woes-and-a-new-impeachment-saga-will-go-on-and-on) that may embarrass the president. Republicans hope that they can find something that does more than that. The chance of a conviction is almost nil. But the hearings will tie up Congress for months.

### Italy’s faltering growth

Italy’s daunting [public debt](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/12/05/why-is-italys-public-debt-burden-so-big) will be back in the spotlight on Thursday. It has been edging down from a peak of almost 160% of GDP in early 2021, largely because of the country’s stronger-than-expected recovery from the pandemic. But now growth is faltering. The economy shrank by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to June. The country’s cabinet was on Wednesday mulling a new treasury assessment that foresees growth of only 0.8% this year and 1.2% in 2024 (down from earlier estimates of 1% and 1.5% respectively).

But [Giorgia Meloni](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/24/italys-hard-right-government-is-starting-to-look-more-radical), the prime minister, needs cash to fulfil election promises of lower taxes and social-security contributions in the budget for 2024. So far she has been fiscally cautious: her government had been aiming for a budget deficit of 3.7% of GDP next year. But late on Wednesday the cabinet raised that projection to 4.3%. The revision could rattle government bond markets.

### The other peace prize

The winners of the “alternative Nobel prize”, the Right Livelihood awards, will be announced on Thursday. They were established in 1980 by Jakob von Uexkull, a philanthropist, after the Nobel Foundation rejected his offer to sell his stamp collection, worth $1m at the time, to fund new prizes for environmental work and the promotion of knowledge. Undeterred, Mr Uexkull founded his own annual prize—always announced just before the Nobels—to celebrate four individuals or organisations making the world “just, peaceful and sustainable”.

This year’s winners have been selected from 170 nominees by a jury composed of experts and past winners of the Right Livelihood prize. The ceremony will be held in Stockholm in November (less than a month before the city hosts the Nobel ceremony). Previous recipients include Bianca Jagger and Greta Thunberg, but also lesser-known humanitarians such as [Wangari Maathai](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2011/10/08/wangari-maathai) and [Baba Amte](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2008/02/28/baba-amte). They have come from 74 countries, often those in the global south. Mr Uexkull’s stamps have made their way across the world after all.

### Caesar’s double-bed is warm

According to a trend that has gone viral on TikTok, some men say they think about the [Roman empire](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/25/rome-fell-will-the-modern-day-west-follow-suit) “every day”. The stock images of pomp, blood and debauchery from films such as “Gladiator” are alluring enough, especially for men. But according to Mary Beard, a professor at Cambridge University famed for her television documentaries, that’s just the half of it.

Her new book, “Emperor of Rome”, published on Thursday, details the lives of 30 emperors who ruled for more than 250 years. The stories are both shocking and entertaining; her ear and eye are alert to the unexpected, the funny and the salacious. Elagabalus, a teenage cross-dresser, not only gave banquets but allegedly showered his guests so liberally with petals that they were smothered to death; Nero rigged the Olympic games so that he won every event he entered. The emperor was the richest person in the world, with 30 palaces in Rome and estates outside it. Little wonder the lifestyle sometimes went to their heads.
