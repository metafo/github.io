A judge ruled that **Donald Trump** fraudulently inflated the value of his assets and his net worth for a decade to secure better loans. The ruling resolves the core legal claim in a [civil lawsuit](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/06/a-primer-on-trumps-criminal-trials) brought by New York’s top prosecutor against Mr Trump, his adult sons and the [Trump Organisation](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/07/two-trump-organisation-companies-are-found-guilty-of-tax-fraud). The trial is due to start on Monday; six other claims will still play out in court. Mr Trump denies wrongdoing.

America’s **Federal Trade Commission** and 17 states filed a lawsuit against **Amazon**, alleging that the online retailer illegally holds monopoly power and keeps prices artificially high, charges sellers unfair fees and stifles competition. Amazon’s general counsel called the lawsuit “wrong on the facts and the law”. The [increasingly active](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/13/american-trustbusters-are-losing-their-focus) antitrust watchdog is led by [Lina Khan](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/21/why-joe-bidens-trustbusters-have-fallen-short-of-their-ambitions), who has long criticised Amazon’s practices.

President **Joe Biden** visited [striking auto workers](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/20/americas-big-car-firms-face-lengthy-strikes) in Detroit, the first time a sitting American president has joined a picket line. Members of the **United Auto Workers** union are on strike mostly over pay. Mr Biden’s trip to Michigan, a swing state in next year’s election, precedes a trip on Wednesday by his potential rival for the presidency, Donald Trump.

The death toll from an explosion on Monday evening in **Nagorno-Karabakh** rose to at least 125. The cause of the blast at a fuel-storage facility remained unclear. Around 28,000 ethnic Armenians have fled the enclave for **Armenia** since [Azerbaijan](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/21/azerbaijan-is-close-to-taking-control-of-nagorno-karabakh) took control of the region last week. An envoy from Armenia will meet with Azerbaijani counterparts in Brussels on Tuesday.

The speaker of **Canada’s** House of Commons, Anthony Rota, resigned after inviting a 98-year old Ukrainian man who served in a Nazi army unit during the second world war to Parliament. Yaroslav Hunka received a standing ovation from Canadian lawmakers and Volodymyr Zelensky during the Ukrainian president’s visit last week. Mr Rota said he was unaware of his guest’s Nazi ties and expressed “profound regret”.

Footage of Admiral Viktor Sokolov, the commander of the **Russian Black Sea fleet**, who Ukrainians claimed to have killed last week, appeared on Russian state television. Ukraine had said that Admiral Viktor Sokolov was among 34 officers killed in a missile strike in [Crimea](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/25/war-has-arrived-in-crimea) last Friday. The footage showed him attending a video conference with other military leaders.

Haim Katz, **Israel’s** tourism minister, arrived in **Saudi Arabia** for a UN conference on tourism—the first official visit by an Israeli minister to the Arab country. Saudi Arabia has long ostracised the Jewish state but, with American encouragement, relations are [improving](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/24/an-israeli-saudi-pact-could-upend-the-middle-east). On September 22nd Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, claimed that the two countries are “at the cusp” of normalising relations.

### Russia’s economic recovery

Last year Russia’s economy faced a severe threat, as Western governments piled on unprecedented sanctions in response to its invasion of Ukraine. But a combination of high prices for oil and gas and efforts by the central bank to crush inflation saved the economy from disaster. GDP, retail sales, industrial production and other data released on Wednesday will show that President Vladimir Putin has a point when he boasts, as he did last week, that “the recovery stage for the Russian economy is finished”.

The unemployment rate is at an all-time low, while GDP is probably 4% or so higher in real terms than it was this time last year. Industrial production is rising smartly. The big challenge now is inflation, which remains high despite the central bank’s strong efforts to control it. Weak oil prices in recent months have depressed the value of [the rouble](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/14/russia-will-struggle-to-cope-with-a-sinking-rouble), raising the cost of imports. But compared with how things seemed 18 months ago, Russia’s economy is looking robust.

### The memory-chip slump

While chipmakers like [Nvidia](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/01/the-ai-boom-has-turbocharged-nvidias-fortunes-can-it-hold-its-position) profit from the artificial-intelligence boom, producers of less snazzy semiconductors are suffering from a bust. Micron, an American memory-chip company, is expected to announce its fourth consecutive quarterly operating loss on Wednesday.

Demand has weakened as consumers have cut back on purchases of smartphones and other electronics. A pandemic-era shortage has been replaced by a supply glut; many companies that use chips in their products have built up stockpiles. Kioxia and Western Digital, rival chipmakers, are talking about a merger.

In May China added to Micron’s woes by [banning](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/05/25/asian-businesses-are-being-dragged-into-the-chip-war) operators of certain infrastructure from using its chips. Micron makes 11% of its revenue from mainland Chinese customers. Half of that is now at risk, it says. The chipmaker is beginning to shift its focus towards India. This week it broke ground on a $2.75bn factory in the country.

### Spain’s next prime minister

On Wednesday Spain’s parliament will vote on whether to make [Alberto Núñez Feijóo](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/07/19/alberto-nunez-feijoo-on-why-he-deserves-to-lead-spain), the leader of the centre-right People’s Party, prime minister. It is exceedingly unlikely to do so. The People’s Party won the most seats in July’s elections but lacks a majority, even with the support of Vox, a hard-right party.

Mr Feijóo’s speech on Tuesday went straight to the topic currently roiling Spain. He denounced the idea that [Pedro Sánchez](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/07/19/as-spain-prepares-to-vote-its-socialist-prime-minister-sets-out-the-case-for-continuity), the incumbent Socialist prime minister, is mulling an amnesty for the Catalan separatists who organised an unconstitutional independence referendum in 2017. Two separatist parties could then vote to return him as prime minister.

A host of former Socialist leaders have come out against an amnesty, Mr Feijóo reminded parliament. But that will probably not convince any Socialist deputies to defect and get him the four more votes he needs. Then will come Mr Sánchez’s turn to face a vote, and a debate over amnesty that will bitterly divide Spain.

### Britain’s delayed trains

HS2, a planned [high-speed rail network](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/25/why-britains-government-would-be-wrong-to-cut-hs2), is Britain’s flagship infrastructure project. The plan, approved in 2009, was to link London to the north of England with a new train line, which would ease congestion on other tracks. Costs have spiralled. The work was originally expected to cost £37.5bn (then worth $62bn) but the latest official estimate—from 2019—is more than £70bn. The high inflation of the past two years has probably raised that to around £100bn.

The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is considering either cancelling the entirety of the stage from Birmingham to Manchester or delaying it by seven years. An announcement could come as soon as Wednesday. (Or it may also be delayed.) The ruckus over HS2 is creating rifts within his Conservative Party. George Osborne, a former chancellor keen on austerity, and Boris Johnson, a spendthrift former prime minister, have both called for the project to go ahead. Awkwardly, on Sunday Mr Sunak will launch his party’s annual conference, in Manchester.

### Zuckerberg’s new toys

Meta’s annual Connect conference begins on Wednesday in—where else?—the metaverse. The two-day virtual event will feature presentations from [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.economist.com/films/2023/08/24/what-you-need-to-know-about-mark-zuckerberg), the chief executive, and other members of the [Meta](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/02/things-are-looking-up-for-meta) high command, who are expected to show off their latest hardware and software to developers.

Mr Zuckerberg has promised to demonstrate the Quest 3, a new headset which, using front-mounted cameras, will offer “mixed reality” (think playing with virtual Lego bricks in your real living room, presented to you in a live video feed). The Quest looks less swish than Apple’s Vision Pro headset, due out next year, but at $499 is one-seventh of the price.

Meta is also tipped to unveil new artificial-intelligence-powered chatbots. Their purpose is reportedly to increase young people’s engagement with Meta’s [social apps](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/04/the-musk-zuckerberg-social-media-smackdown), from Instagram to Threads. The virtual buddies may also be a handy way to populate [the metaverse](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/05/11/what-is-the-metaverse), where, despite Mr Zuckerberg’s urging, few humans so far hang out.
