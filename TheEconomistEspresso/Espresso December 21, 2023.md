Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

The **UN Security Council** for the third time delayed a vote on the United Arab Emirates’ proposal calling for a ceasefire in Gaza to allow in aid. Originally scheduled for Monday, the vote is now expected to happen on Thursday, as members negotiate over the text to avoid a veto from America. (It has previously vetoed two similar resolutions.) Meanwhile Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of **Hamas**, arrived in Cairo to discuss the [war in Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/14/israels-current-large-scale-operation-is-the-last-one-in-gaza) with Egyptian officials. Egypt helped broker last month’s ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. According to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, the Palestinian death toll has now passed 20,000.

**Britain’s** annual inflation rate fell sharply to 3.9% in November, down from 4.6% in October and well below expectations. The two-year low was driven by falls in food and transport costs. It is [good news](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/the-outlook-for-the-british-economy-is-better-than-expected) for the country, which many worried would remain stuck with high inflation even as rates fell throughout the rest of the rich world.

**Venezuela** agreed to release some political prisoners and “wrongfully detained” **Americans**, a condition of a [deal](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/10/19/joe-biden-lifts-sanctions-on-venezuela-but-not-without-conditions) it struck with the Biden administration in October in exchange for lifting some sanctions. It freed ten jailed Americans and will extradite a Malaysian businessman convicted in a US Navy corruption scandal. America also released an ally of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s dictator, whom it had indicted for bribery—a victory for Mr Maduro.

The election under way in the **Democratic Republic of Congo** faced delays and disruptions, leaving some voters having to fight to enter polling stations. Félix Tshisekedi, the incumbent president, faces 18 challengers, one of whom described the situation as “total chaos”. Although the country is [plagued by violent militias](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/14/congos-crucial-election-may-be-heading-for-disaster), the UN on Tuesday agreed to withdraw its peacekeeping troops on the request of Mr Tshisekedi.

**Orsted**, a Danish renewables company, announced it will build the world’s largest offshore wind farm off the coast of Britain. Like [much of the industry](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/12/04/the-renewables-business-faces-a-make-or-break-moment), the firm, which is the world’s biggest offshore wind developer, has suffered a turbulent year. In November it cancelled two projects in America because of supply chain issues, unexpected costs and higher interest rates.

The government of **Emmanuel Macron**, France’s president, was plunged into crisis after passing its flagship immigration bill. The law split Mr Macron’s coalition; 52 out of its 251 members abstained or voted against the bill, complaining that it was pandering to the [hard right](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/14/the-hard-right-is-getting-closer-to-power-all-over-europe). As if to confirm their worst fears, Marine Le Pen threw her hard-right party’s support behind the bill.

**Britain’s** Supreme Court ruled that **AI** cannot hold patents. The case was originally brought by [Stephen Thaler](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/04/04/the-inventor-who-fell-in-love-with-his-ai), an American computer scientist who believes his AI model, DABUS, is sentient and wants it to be recognised as the inventor of a food container and a light beacon. The court concluded that “an inventor must be a person”, and DABUS, it said, is not.

### 2023 in review: The world economy cannot continue to defy gravity

*This week we are looking back on 2023. Today, finance and economics*

Only a year ago, the conventional wisdom was that the world economy would soon fall into recession. But America’s economy has roared on in 2023, growing at a stunning annualised pace of 5.2% in the third quarter. And even without a global downturn, inflation is falling around the world.

This good cheer, however, cannot last. The foundations for today’s growth look unstable. One reason why [America’s economy](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/the-world-economy-is-defying-gravity-that-cannot-last) has fared better than expected is because its consumers have been spending cash they accumulated during the pandemic. When those excess savings dwindle, high interest rates will bite, forcing consumers to spend less freely. Trouble will also emerge if rates stay higher for longer—business bankruptcies are already rising, for instance.

The world economy is also being propped up by unsustainable fiscal largesse. All told, government debt in the rich world is now higher, as a share of GDP, than at any time since after the Napoleonic wars.

### 2023 in review: A new golden age of the worker

The belief that capitalism is rigged to benefit the wealthy and punish workers has shaped how millions view the world. But it may not be true. Wage gaps are shrinking across the rich world. In America real weekly earnings for those at the bottom of the rung are growing faster than those at the top. What is bringing about this [blue-collar bonanza](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/30/a-new-age-of-the-worker-will-overturn-conventional-thinking)?

Governments untied the purse-strings after covid-19 struck. America has continued to run big deficits. Demand for labour has therefore remained high. What’s more, higher productivity in sectors affected by the rise of AI will boost demand for work in sectors where AI can add little (think manual labour). Higher demand has met constrained supply. The prime working-age population is growing at its slowest pace on record in the rich world.

This [golden age for workers](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/28/welcome-to-a-golden-age-for-workers) is still young—and possibly vulnerable. Yet it has demonstrated the best route to future prosperity for all. Governments should not shackle markets, but try to increase the size of the economic pie.

### 2023 in review: Are free markets history?

Fragile [supply chains](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/10/02/attempts-to-make-supply-chains-resilient-are-likely-to-fail), threats to national security, the energy transition and cost-of-living crises—all have recently demanded action by governments. But they have also spurred what we call “[homeland economics](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/05/are-free-markets-history)”, a protectionist and intervention-heavy ideology administered by states. Open markets have been left in the dust as governments jettison the principles that made the world rich.

This mix of [protection, spending and regulation](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/10/02/governments-across-the-world-are-discovering-homeland-economics) comes at a dear cost. America’s rising debt-service bill will probably match its all-time high before the end of the decade. Homeland economics is also a blunt instrument in a time of rapid change. The energy and AI transitions are too big for governments to plan—ideas need to be tested by markets, not states.

The good news is that homeland economics will bring about its own demise. To give one example, a stagnating, repressive China may no longer hold out the promise of state-directed prosperity. Turning the tide in favour of free markets will not be easy. But think of the prize.

### 2023 in review: Wall Street wants to manage your wealth

Wealth managers are the hottest thing on Wall Street. For an annual fee of around 1% of invested assets, they are increasingly helping clients allocate assets, minimise tax bills and plan for retirements. Firms are piling into the business, lured by the promise of fat profits as the world gets richer. In India, for example, there were 849,000 dollar millionaires last year, nearly 23 times as many as in 2000.

This [boom](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/07/wall-street-is-racing-to-manage-your-wealth-that-is-a-good-thing) is good news for companies and regulators, who may be relieved to see a steady growth business bolted on to the boom-and-bust cycles of capital markets. Punters stand to benefit, too. [Wealth managers](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/05/the-100trn-battle-for-the-worlds-wealthiest-people) act as caretakers who are supposed to act in your best interest when offering financial advice. They are not active managers that try to beat the market—which cannot beat passive returns, on average, after fees. For those who want to preserve and grow their hard-earned fortunes, wealth managers are welcome.
