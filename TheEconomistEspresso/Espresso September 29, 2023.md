## The world in brief

### September 29, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**America’s** upper and lower chambers advanced separate pieces of legislation as federal agencies issued warnings that the government was increasingly likely to [shut down](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/28/americas-government-will-probably-shut-down-again-on-october-1st). The Senate will debate its stopgap funding bill, which Republicans in the House of Representatives have rejected. The House, meanwhile, will vote on partisan spending bills that would not avert a shutdown by October 1st.

**Germany’s** annual inflation rate slowed to 4.3% in September, down from 6.4% in August and the lowest since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year. The figures bode well for the rest of the euro zone, which releases inflation data on Friday. But Germany’s economic prospects remain mired by [slow growth](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/17/is-germany-once-again-the-sick-man-of-europe) and low confidence.

Three people, including a 14-year-old girl, were killed in a rare shooting in **Rotterdam**, in the Netherlands. The gunman allegedly opened fire in a flat before murdering a teacher at a hospital affiliated with Erasmus University. He tried to set both buildings on fire. The suspected shooter, according to police, is a student at the university; he was arrested near the hospital.

**Taiwan** unveiled its first locally made submarine, built at a cost of more than $1.6bn. The *Narwhal* is the first of eight such planned vessels and will enter service in 2025, joining Taiwan’s current fleet of two ageing Dutch-made boats. Taiwan struggles to buy modern submarines from abroad but hopes the fleet could complicate a Chinese blockade or [invasion](https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/2023/07/27/data-on-air-bases-suggest-a-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan-may-not-be-imminent).

**America** accused **China** of trying to “reshape the global information environment to its advantage” through propaganda, disinformation and censorship. The report by the Department of State, which cites examples of how China’s “digital authoritarianism” could impede freedom of speech around the world, is a sign of yet more [hostility](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/03/30/why-the-china-us-contest-is-entering-a-new-and-more-dangerous-phase) between the two countries.

**Evergrande**, a [beleaguered](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/16/how-bad-could-chinas-property-crisis-get) Chinese property company, said that Xu Jiayin, its founder and chairman, is being investigated over suspected “crimes”. The company suspended trading of its shares earlier on Thursday, following reports that Mr Xu had been placed under police surveillance. The firm’s shares last closed at HK$0.32 ($0.04) on Wednesday. In 2020 they had been as high as HK$25.80.

Police arrested a 16-year-old boy in connection with what appears to be the intentional felling of the Sycamore Gap tree at Hadrian’s Wall in **Britain**. The tree, which was chopped down early Thursday morning, is thought to have stood next to the Roman-built wall for hundreds of years. It gained international fame after featuring in a 1991 film about Robin Hood.

### Ukraine’s slow push south

Ukraine’s counter-offensive may not have long left to run. Since mid-September, Russia has been throwing troops from its 25th Combined Arms Army, a large formation kept in reserve, to contain Ukraine’s attacks on the southern front.

But Ukraine may not have many of its own reserves to feed in. Earlier this week the country’s army committed new forces to the southern front in the hope of a breakthrough around Verbove. That town forms the eastern edge of a salient, or bulge, in the southern front, with the town of Robotyne at the western end.

On September 23rd General Oleksandr Tarnavsky, the commander of Ukraine’s forces in the south, made his expectations clear: “Tokmak is the minimum goal”. That in itself represents a [lowering of expectations](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/21/ukraine-faces-a-long-war-a-change-of-course-is-needed); Ukrainian commanders had hoped they could reach Melitopol, further south. Yet even Tokmak remains some distance away. Ukraine would need to punch through more defences beyond the Robotyne-Verbove line. That is not looking likely.

### Europe’s hard landing is here

The [European Central Bank](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/13/has-the-european-central-bank-become-too-powerful) is done raising interest rates. That is the conclusion of markets from recent economic data and statements by the bank which indicated that rates are high enough. A release on Friday of euro-zone inflation data may confirm that assessment.

Economic activity continues to decline, and so does inflation. The purchasing managers’ index for September showed that the euro-zone economy remains in recession, albeit not as strongly as in August. Inflation data from [Spain](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/07/19/as-spain-prepares-to-vote-its-socialist-prime-minister-sets-out-the-case-for-continuity), which has not suffered as much as other economies, suggests that the current slight increase in energy prices is only pushing inflation up a little. Data from Germany suggests that the rate of inflation is falling fast, to now just 4.3%, as energy and transport price-subsidies from last summer drop out of the index. But that is still double the ECB target of about 2%. By the time inflation comes back down to that level, the euro zone may be deep in recession.

### Germany’s immigration worries

As voters’ concerns about migrants boost the poll ratings for [Germany’s far right](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/14/germanys-rampant-hard-right-afd-puts-other-parties-in-a-fix), their rivals are taking note. On Wednesday Olaf Scholz, the chancellor, overruled his Green coalition partners by removing objections to a toughening of [European rules on asylum seekers](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/15/why-europes-asylum-policy-desperately-needs-rebooting)—designed to redistribute responsibility for migrants and to speed up the processing of claims—just before a meeting of EU ministers to decide the issue. Mr Scholz’s party also announced temporary border controls with Poland and the Czech Republic to stem the flow of asylum seekers.

Not to be outplayed, Friedrich Merz, leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union, said feeble policies meant that foreigners awaiting deportation get luxury medical care while Germans wait in queues. His claim exploits public angst. A surge of [Ukrainian refugees](https://www.economist.com/interactive/international/2023/02/22/you-will-always-be-0-percent-prepared-ukraines-refugees-on-life-far-from-home) pushed immigration to a record 1.14m in 2022. But the number of asylum seekers from elsewhere, especially Afghanistan and Syria, is soaring too: it reached 220,000 between January and August, up 77% from the same period last year.

### Netflix ejects its DVD business

Twenty-five years ago a startup mail-order company called Netflix posted its first DVD, a copy of “Beetlejuice”. On Friday the firm will send out its final red envelope, as it completes its long transition from distribution by mail to online streaming.

In the late 2000s Netflix was sending out 1.6m discs a day, making it one of the biggest customers of the [US Postal Service](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/13/louis-dejoys-ambitious-plans-for-americas-postal-service). It was only in 2007 that it introduced the option to watch movies online. Customers were sceptical at first. But nearly 240m subscribers later, the new medium has triumphed.

Ted Sarandos, a former video-store clerk who is now co-chief executive of the company, worth $170bn on the stockmarket, has said that the DVD business paved the way for streaming by offering consumers endless choice and the ability to binge-watch series. That is the formula that has made Netflix rich. But 5.2bn posted discs later, the company has decided at last that it is time to fast-forward to a digital-only business.

### AI Goes To Hollywood

Artificial intelligence is a hot topic in Hollywood, both behind the scenes and on the screen. The use of AI is a bone of contention in the ongoing actors’ strike as well as in the [recently ended](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/25/hollywoods-strike-enters-its-final-act-as-writers-reach-a-deal) writers’ one. AI is also central to the plots of several recent films. “Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One” and “M3GAN” had AI villains. So too does “The Creator”, a science-fiction film directed and co-written by Gareth Edwards, which is released on Friday.

John David Washington plays a soldier in a war between humans and robots. His allegiance is tested when the robots’ latest super-weapon looks and acts like a harmless child (played by Madeleine Yuna Voyles). The film is hardly a profound treatise on the ethics of Chat GPT. But it is an impressively gritty combat epic with similarities to “The Terminator”, “Blade Runner” and “Apocalypse Now”. It has plenty of real intelligence to go with the artificial kind.
