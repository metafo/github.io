Donald Trump cruised to victory in South Carolina’s Republican primary, winning 60% of the vote. Electors [preferred him](https://web.archive.org/web/20240226030131/https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/22/why-is-nikki-haley-losing-to-donald-trump-on-home-ground) to Nikki Haley, who governed the state for six years but could not convince South Carolinians that she would perform better in this year’s presidential election. “Our country will fall apart if we make the wrong choices,” warned Ms Haley, predicting that Mr Trump would not defeat Joe Biden. Mr Trump said anyone donating to Ms Haley’s campaign would be “permanently barred from the MAGA camp”, referring to the America-first movement he leads.

Israel’s war cabinet met to consider new proposals for a ceasefire in the war in Gaza, following [talks](https://web.archive.org/web/20240226030131/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/01/americas-shuttle-diplomacy-to-wind-down-the-war-in-gaza) with mediators from Qatar, Egypt and America in Paris. Israel will reportedly send a delegation to Qatar this week for further talks. Meanwhile, Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, indicated that the cabinet will meet soon to sanction military operations in [Rafah](https://web.archive.org/web/20240226030131/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/13/if-israel-invades-hell-looms-in-rafah), a city in the south of Gaza.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that 31,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed since Russia’s invasion of its neighbour two years ago. This was the first official casualty figure from Ukraine for over a year. Separately, Ukraine’s strategic industries minister said that the country tripled its weapons production last year. The comments came amid Western efforts to boost arms supplies to Ukraine on the second anniversary of the war.

Qatar will develop a vast new project for exporting liquefied natural gas, according to the country’s energy minister. Saad Al-Kaabi said the facility will be capable of exporting 16m tonnes a year, bringing Qatar’s annual production capacity to 142m tonnes by the end of the decade. The announcement follows President Joe Biden’s [decision](https://web.archive.org/web/20240226030131/https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/01/joe-bidens-limits-on-lng-exports-wont-help-the-climate) to pause all pending LNG-export developments in America.

The Australian federal government pledged to provide whatever assistance Victoria needs as the state battles a wildfire emergency. Over the last few days bushfires have killed livestock and forced thousands of people to leave their homes. The authorities warned that extreme heat forecast for this week could further fan the flames.

The body of Alexei Navalny, the Russian [opposition leader](https://web.archive.org/web/20240226030131/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/16/how-alexei-navalny-robbed-putin-of-his-power) who died in prison last week, was returned to his mother. Kira Yarmysh, Mr Navalny’s press secretary, said his funeral is yet to be arranged. “We don’t know whether the authorities will interfere with carrying it out,” she said. On Thursday, Mr Navalny’s mother said that Russian authorities wanted to bury him in secret.

London’s Heathrow airport has abandoned plans to build a third runway, reported the *Times*. The paper cited leaked papers that show the congested airport’s new boss, Thomas Woldbye, wants to explore ways to accommodate millions more passengers without expanding its footprint. Europe’s busiest airport has been pondering plans to build a new runway for more than [75 years](https://web.archive.org/web/20240226030131/https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/06/28/heathrows-third-runway-could-be-blown-off-course-by-pollution).

### Correction: 

An earlier edition of The World in Brief described a renewable-energy project in Gujarat as the world’s largest solar park. It is in fact a hybrid wind and solar facility. Sorry.

### What Michigan’s primary will reveal

On Tuesday voters in Michigan go to the polls in the state’s presidential primary election. Joe Biden and Donald Trump will surely prevail in the Democratic and [Republican contests](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/25/why-nikki-haley-crushed-in-her-home-state-vows-to-fight-on) respectively. But observers will be watching for clues about what might happen in the swing state in November’s general election.

Democrats fear that the war in Gaza is costing Mr Biden votes. Michigan has one of the largest Arab-American populations in the country. Several Democratic politicians, including Rashida Tlaib, who represents much of Detroit in the House, have asked voters to say they are “uncommitted” instead of voting for the president.

For Republicans, questions surround the chaotic condition of the local party. This primary will, in fact, assign less than a third of the state’s 55 delegates who will select the Republican nominee. The rest will be awarded at a convention in early March. But the state Republican Party is torn by infighting and is reportedly in dire financial straits, so the process could be a mess.

### Europe’s plan for more arms

On Tuesday the European Commission will unveil plans to boost [arms and ammunition production](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/14/can-europe-arm-ukraine-or-even-itself). The European Defence Industrial Strategy will probably aim high. Ukrainian forces are [on the back foot](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/02/21/is-ukraine-losing-the-war-against-russia) against Russia and help from America looks uncertain as a $61bn military-aid package remains stuck in Congress.

One goal of the EU’s plan will be to incentivise big cross-border investments in defence. Thierry Breton, the bloc’s internal-market commissioner, would also like EU members to jointly develop new cyber and space capabilities, as well as hypersonic air defence and, in time, an aircraft carrier.

Still, giving Ukraine what it needs will be a challenge. Josep Borrell, the bloc’s foreign-policy chief, recently admitted that the EU would only be able to provide around half of 1m artillery shells that it had promised to send by March. There is also a political gap between EU countries near Russia, which want to increase defence spending more urgently, and the bigger, richer ones farther away.

### Polish farmers march on Warsaw

For weeks Polish farmers have disrupted transport across Poland, blocking main roads, ports and railways on the border with Ukraine. On Tuesday the protests are ramping up as farmers bring their ire to Warsaw, the capital.

[Farmers across Europe](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/01/europes-grumpy-farmers-are-a-symptom-of-wider-malaise) have been protesting against the European Union’s green legislation, which pushes for limits on the use of chemicals and ambitious caps on greenhouse-gas emissions. Polish farmers have another concern on their doorstep: cheap imports from Ukraine. The EU lifted grain duties in 2022 to help Ukraine’s war-battered economy. Polish farmers say they cannot compete.

That is a headache for Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister, who has sought to present his new government as more co-operative with the EU. But he is also reluctant to antagonise the farmers ahead of local elections in April. The raised pitchforks and road-blocking tractors only make the balancing act harder.

### The challenges of the energy transition

On Tuesday climate scientists, policymakers and business leaders gather in London for International Energy Week. The focus of the discussions will be the tricky process of [transitioning away](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/13/in-a-first-cop28-targets-the-root-cause-of-climate-change) from fossil fuels. Comprehensively switching to renewables will bring significant challenges. The output of wind and solar energy sources is highly variable compared with fossil fuels, the supply of which is more controllable. That makes planning for fluctuations in supply and demand harder.

The three-day conference will consider ways to [modify energy systems](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2023/04/05/the-electric-grid-is-about-to-be-transformed) to that end, including by utilising artificial intelligence. The process of transforming and expanding power infrastructure is accelerating at pace. For instance, in Gujarat, a state in western India, a vast hybrid wind-solar park was recently connected to the grid. It will eventually be the size of Singapore and, it is hoped, will provide enough power for 18m homes.

### A new adaptation of “Shogun”

“Shogun” was a best-selling novel by James Clavell, a British writer, published in 1975. It told the story of John Blackthorne, an English sailor, who is marooned in a fishing village in “the Japans” at the end of the 16th century. He encounters Lord Toranaga Yoshi (inspired by [Tokugawa Ieyasu](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/23/keeping-up-with-the-tokugawas), the founder of the last shogunate) as civil war looms. The book, and a television adaptation from 1980, caused a sensation in the West by introducing a new generation to Japanese culture.

Now FX, a subsidiary of Disney, has made a new version for television, released on Tuesday. Its treatment of the plot and lavish visuals are impressive. It also adapts the story to the sensitivities of the 21st century. In the series from 1980, the Japanese characters were largely secondary—their intermittent dialogues in their native tongue were not even translated. In the FX series, however, the Japanese is subtitled, and the characters are portrayed with depth. That, the showrunner suggests, endows it with a “spirit of common respect” between East and West.
