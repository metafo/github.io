Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Yoav Gallant, **Israel’s** defence minister, said his country would do everything needed to “ensure that **Gaza** will pose no threat to Israel”. But he insisted there should be “no Israeli civilian presence” in [the enclave](https://web.archive.org/web/20240106044821/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/04/war-hunger-and-disease-stalk-gazas-22m-people) when fighting finishes. Previously, [Israel’s leaders](https://web.archive.org/web/20240106044821/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/03/binyamin-netanyahu-is-botching-the-war-time-to-sack-him) have given few details on how they think Gaza should be governed after the war. Meanwhile, Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, arrived in Turkey, the first stop on a trip that will also include visits to Israel and the West Bank.

America’s **Supreme Court** agreed to hear **Donald Trump’s** appeal against the ruling that [he is ineligible](https://web.archive.org/web/20240106044821/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/01/02/a-clash-over-trumps-disqualification-lands-at-the-supreme-court) to appear on Colorado’s Republican primary ballot. In December that state’s supreme court disqualified him, pointing to a [provision in the 14th Amendment](https://web.archive.org/web/20240106044821/https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/20/could-the-14th-amendment-bar-donald-trump-from-becoming-president-again) barring insurrectionists who have earlier sworn to support the constitution from office. Similar cases are pending across the country. The court will hear arguments next month.

**America’s** jobs market strengthened unexpectedly, adding 216,000 jobs in December. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%. The figures suggest that the country’s labour market continues to [run hot](https://web.archive.org/web/20240106044821/https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/28/welcome-to-a-golden-age-for-workers), and that wage growth remains strong. That will probably lead the Federal Reserve to hold off from cutting interest rates until it is confident inflation is under control.

Wayne LaPierre, the [embattled and longtime leader](https://web.archive.org/web/20240106044821/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/01/23/what-next-for-the-bankrupt-nra) of America’s powerful **National Rifle Association**, will resign, apparently for health reasons. The news comes just before a corruption trial—in which the NRA is accused of diverting millions of dollars to benefit its executives, including Mr LaPierre—begins on Monday in Manhattan. The gun-rights advocacy group, which has lost members and revenue in recent years, denies wrongdoing.

America’s **Food and Drug Administration** authorised Florida’s plan to import medicines from **Canada**, where they are cheaper. Several states have asked the FDA for such approval. The pharmaceutical industry objects to the proposed move, and its primary lobbying organisation is expected to file a lawsuit to block it. Florida says it would save $150m annually under the plan.

**China** launched an investigation assessing whether EU liquor imports, especially of brandy, are unfairly undercutting Chinese producers. The move is in retaliation to a [similar EU probe](https://web.archive.org/web/20240106044821/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/12/07/china-and-the-eu-risk-a-trade-war) into Chinese electric vehicles. China’s brandy imports from the EU, worth $1.6bn between January and November of 2023, are dwarfed by the bloc’s imports of Chinese EVs, which were worth $12.7bn in the same period.

Officials in **Belgorod**, a Russian border city, offered to evacuate residents concerned for their safety following a series of Ukrainian aerial attacks on the city, which killed 25 people. Russian authorities have previously sought to [downplay](https://web.archive.org/web/20240106044821/https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/06/08/pretending-that-everything-is-under-control-in-russia) disruption linked to the war. Earlier, the White House said that **Russia** was using ballistic missiles from **North Korea** to attack Ukraine.

### A weight-loss pill with a twist

In 2023 Wegovy and Ozempic, two brands of the weight-loss drug [semaglutide](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/03/02/new-drugs-could-spell-an-end-to-the-worlds-obesity-epidemic), became household names, partly owing to a host of celebrity endorsements. Now researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a new [weight-loss](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/expect-a-bumper-year-for-weight-loss-drugs) pill that contains no semaglutide, or indeed any other drug.

When the stomach is full of food, its walls expand, triggering the release of hormones that induce the feeling of satiety. Semaglutide mimics one of these hormones, GLP-1. The snappily named VIBES (Vibrating Ingestible BioElectronic Stimulator) pill, by contrast, uses vibrations to reduce appetite. It contains a tiny motor, which is triggered by contact with stomach acid. Its movement activates stretch receptors that line the stomach, causing it to distend and induce the appetite-suppressing hormones. Pigs given a VIBES pill before mealtime ate 40% less food, and gained less weight. Its inventors say it can be manufactured more cheaply than Wegovy and Ozempic. If so, the VIBES pill could have semaglutide vendors quivering.

### Ukraine’s Christmas snub to Russia

For the first time Ukraine will not officially celebrate Christmas on January 7th, the day the Russian Orthodox Church observes the holiday. In July, not long after a Russian strike on a historic cathedral in Odessa, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, signed into law a parliamentary bill that [moved Christmas](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/01/13/ukraines-orthodox-church-may-change-the-date-of-its-christmas) from the Russian Church’s Julian calendar to the Gregorian date of December 25th. The Russian Orthodox Church, which [claims sovereignty](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/01/06/why-did-the-russian-and-ukrainian-orthodox-churches-split) over Ukrainian branches of orthodoxy, is crying foul.

In Ukraine support for the switch is strong—on December 24th and 25th many celebrated with carolling, gift-giving and feasts. The Russian Orthodox Church has backed the invasion of Ukraine. Its head, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, an ally of Vladimir Putin, has said that death in battle “washes away all sins” of Russian troops. Mr Zelensky has described Ukraine’s calendar change as a “renunciation of Russian heritage”. It is also a step toward the West, including its rhythms of work and rest.

### Bangladesh’s election was a foregone conclusion

[Sheikh Hasina](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/24/sheikh-hasina-is-asias-iron-lady) won a fifth term as Bangladesh’s prime minister, three of which she has held consecutively since 2009, after Bangladeshis headed to the polls on Sunday.

Her party, the Awami League, has assailed Bangladesh’s democracy and hounded the opposition. Observers say the party has encouraged its members to run as independents to manufacture competition. The main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, boycotted the poll. It claims that as many as 20,000 of its members have been arrested since October, when protesters clashed with police (who, along with the courts, have long been captured by the AL) at a party rally. Each side blamed the other for the violence.

Still, Sheikh Hasina remains popular. A survey by an American pollster, published in August, gave her a 70% approval rating. Despite recent [economic woes](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/01/bangladeshs-economic-miracle-is-in-jeopardy), growth remains fairly robust. Sheikh Hasina’s grip on power is unshakeable.

### Buying art in Uruguay

Uruguay is perhaps not known for its contemporary-arts scene. Este Arte, the South American country’s only art fair, aims to redress that. For the past decade the event has promoted Uruguay’s living artists and created a local market for their work. The tenth edition opened this weekend in the laid-back resort town of José Ignacio. The fair’s model is small but selective. After the covid-19 pandemic, the organisers cut the number of exhibitors by two-thirds and expanded the cultural programme to stimulate discussions about art.

Local tax rules are a boon for the country’s art market. Artworks sold in Uruguay are exempt from VAT; customs tax is not levied if a piece is temporarily imported. That contrasts with neighbouring Brazil—Latin America’s biggest art market—where collectors and gallerists often contend with steep tariffs on foreign works. Uruguay’s approach makes it an attractive proposition for international art buyers, who may begin paying the country more attention.

### Weekend profile: Lai Ching-te, front-runner in Taiwan’s presidential race

Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s vice-president, has held virtually every senior political post on the island. On January 13th the softly spoken former doctor hopes to round out his CV with the top one: president.

The veteran politician, also known as William Lai, represents the ruling independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party. Before becoming vice-president he was a lawmaker, a popular two-term mayor and, from 2017 to 2019, premier under the departing president, Tsai Ing-wen. He has promised to stick to Ms Tsai’s careful approach to the island’s [thorniest issue](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/china-is-watching-closely-who-will-be-taiwans-next-president): Taiwan is independent from China, but no further declarations are necessary. Beijing’s leaders consider the 24m-strong democracy to be their own territory, and have threatened to take the diplomatically isolated island by military force if necessary.

It was China that inspired Mr Lai, now 64, to go into politics. He grew up in poverty in a small coalmining village in Taiwan’s far north. Brought up by his mother (his father, a miner, died when he was a toddler), he went on to study medicine at prestigious universities in Taiwan before obtaining a master’s degree in public health from Harvard. In 1996 Taiwan, a decade after emerging from nearly 40 years of martial law, held its first direct presidential election. Mr Lai felt compelled to run for office after China lobbed missiles into the nearby sea to sway the vote toward China-friendly candidates.

Two such opponents are running against Mr Lai, who is narrowly [leading the polls](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-taiwan-election). His victory is far from certain. The DPP once appealed to younger voters, but after eight years in power it has a stuffy “establishment” image. Wage growth has not outpaced inflation and housing prices are steep. Mr Lai has doggedly stuck to the party’s goal of shutting down Taiwan’s nuclear power plants by 2025, stoking fears of an energy crunch. Most important, China refuses to have formal contact with DPP governments.

Mr Lai in particular has provoked China’s ire, having described himself in 2017 as a “pragmatic worker for Taiwan independence”. Officials in Beijing recently dubbed him a “Taiwan independence liar” and “hoodlum to the extreme”. Mr Lai says he is open to dialogue with the power across the strait. Many Taiwanese hope it will end a ban on Chinese tourists, which would boost Taiwan’s economy. But if Mr Lai wins, China seems set to continue to threaten and isolate the island. That fuels criticism from the opposition presidential candidates that the DPP makes Taiwan unsafe.
