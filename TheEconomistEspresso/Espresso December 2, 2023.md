The seven-day [truce](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas) between **Hamas** and **Israel** came to an abrupt end. Israel said it had resumed fighting in Gaza after shooting down a rocket launched from the enclave. The Israeli military also dropped leaflets over Khan Younis, the most northerly big city in southern Gaza, warning residents to move further south. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, claimed that Hamas had reneged on the terms of the truce by failing to release some of the agreed-upon hostages. Hamas accused Israel of breaking its commitment to allow fuel trucks into Gaza. Negotiators are reportedly trying to broker another pause in the fighting.

**America**’s House of Representatives voted to expel **George Santos**, a [scandal-ridden](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/17/george-santos-is-the-congressman-america-deserves) Republican congressman from New York. Mr Santos—who has pleaded not guilty to federal corruption charges—is only the [sixth member ever](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/29/what-does-it-take-to-expel-an-american-congressman) to be ousted and only the third after the Civil War. The House previously voted to save him, but a recent report from the House Ethics Committee convinced his colleagues to expel.

**Asia’s** factory activity remained sluggish in November in the face of weak global demand. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which rely on exports, reported stagnant activity. A private survey of manufacturing in China showed an unexpected month-on-month expansion in November, bolstered by an increase in domestic orders. On Thursday an official survey, which focuses on big, state-owned companies, showed activity contracting for a second month.

**Japan** expressed concern that **America** was still flying Osprey aircraft over its airspace, following a crash this week. The military-transport vehicles can travel at speed and hover over the ground [like a helicopter](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/08/23/future-helicopters-will-fly-in-new-ways). America’s ally said it had requested the aircraft’s grounding whilst safety concerns were investigated. One person died and six are still missing after the American aircraft’s crash.

A federal judge paused a law in Montana banning downloads of **TikTok**, a Chinese-owned video-sharing app, that was expected to go into effect in January, saying it “likely violates the First Amendment”. Lawmakers introduced [the bill](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/23/america-may-be-a-step-closer-to-banning-tiktok) in February, arguing that TikTok could be used by China’s government to spy on American citizens.

The International Court of Justice, the UN’s top court, partly sided with **Guyana** in a dispute with **Venezuela** over the [potentially oil-rich](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/12/tiny-guyana-could-soon-become-one-of-the-worlds-giant-oil-exporters) Essequibo region, which Guyana controls. Venezuela plans to hold a referendum on Sunday to affirm its claim on the land. While the court did not forbid the vote, it ordered Venezuela not to change the status quo.

The Kremlin appointed **Valery Gergiev**, a renowned but controversial maestro known to be a supporter of Vladimir Putin, to head the **Bolshoi Theatre** in Moscow. Mr Gergiev is already head of the Mariinsky Theatre, another prominent arts institution in St Petersburg. Mr Gergiev’s predecessor, Vladimir Urin, resigned on Thursday. He had spoken openly about the challenges that politics posed for the theatre.

### What next for the Israel-Hamas war

Another stage in the bloody war between Israel and Hamas has begun. On Friday Hamas resumed launching rockets towards Israel; the IDF carried out air strikes on Gaza. The resumption in fighting ended a seven-day truce, during which groups of hostages captured by Hamas on its October 7th attack had been released in return for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. The truce fell apart because Hamas reportedly failed to release more hostages, having on Thursday freed just eight, rather than the agreed ten. (Hamas claims that Israel made “a prior decision to resume the criminal aggression”.)

What now? Israel’s resumed offensive will probably focus on the [south of Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/26/a-brutal-battle-for-southern-gaza-beckons-after-the-truce-ends), where around 2m Palestinians are crowded. As the truce ended, Israeli strikes on that part of the enclave killed over 100 people, according to Hamas authorities. Israel also urged civilians to leave the southern city of Khan Younis, where it believes the Hamas leadership is hiding. The militant group still holds around 140 hostages. Their fate remains uncertain.

### The biggest study of universal basic income

What do people do with free money? The world’s largest trial of [universal basic income](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/19/what-the-spread-of-universal-basic-income-schemes-says-about-americas-safety-net), which released its findings on Friday, aims to find out. In 2017 GiveDirectly, an American charity, began sending $22.50 a month to thousands of Kenyan villagers. Armed with data from the first two years, economists have compared the outcomes among four groups: people who received the money for two years, people who received it for two and were told to expect it for another ten, people who were given a lump sum of $500, and a control group who got nothing.

Long-term and lump-sum recipients started more businesses—often giving up farm jobs to do so—and created more revenue than the other groups, probably because they felt able to make larger investments. In most recipient groups, spending on education increased. The study adds to a growing body of evidence with a hopeful message: if you give poor people money, they tend to use it well.

### A footballing regeneration in America

The American women’s national football team is preparing for a new chapter. After two World Cup wins in the 2010s, which helped them to [break through](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/08/16/womens-football-is-becoming-bigger-and-better) to mainstream audiences, key players have stood down. Megan Rapinoe, the team’s talismanic forward, retired after this summer’s World Cup alongside Julie Ertz, a defender. On Saturday the team plays the first of two friendlies against China. Will they be able to regroup?

The remaining squad is a mixed bunch. Of eight midfielders, three have more than 80 caps each; the remaining five have 11 between them. The leadership is changing, too. Twila Kilgore is holding the fort until May when Emma Hayes joins from Chelsea, an English side. Ms Hayes’s primary task will be blooding the next generation, while leaning on the experience of the old guard. Two big tests, the CONCACAF W Gold Cup and the Olympics, await next year.

### Ethiopia’s artistic legacy

Ethiopia’s history is one of teeming diversity. The country is home to some 80 ethnic and religious groups, including all three Abrahamic faiths, and it has had cultural contact with Europe and the Middle East for centuries. This melting pot produced an abundance of visual art, of which the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore presents a rich cross-section in a show opening on Saturday.

The exhibit’s more than 220 objects span 1,750 years. They range from early coins to Christian wall paintings (Ethiopians adopted Christianity in the 4th century) to contemporary art. The result is a show as deep as it is wide. One work, “All in One”, an Aïda Muluneh photograph from 2016, shows a woman covered in African body paint but dressed and posed like the Virgin Mary. Like the exhibition as a whole, it can be appreciated as the product of a long tradition still very much alive.

### Weekend profile: Sultan al-Jaber, the UAE’s oil chief

Tens of thousands of delegates have descended on Dubai, the gleaming financial capital of the United Arab Emirates, for the UN’s COP28 climate summit. Many are sceptical that the UAE, as a leading member of the OPEC oil cartel, cares much about climate change. Some believe it is an elaborate charade to drum up oil and gas deals and greenwash the fossil-fuel industry.

[Sultan al-Jaber](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/24/sultan-al-jaber-believes-cop28-can-find-a-new-way-forward-on-climate) is the man in the crosshairs. To see if he is up to the job, consider his double life. The 50-year-old is indeed the boss of ADNOC, the UAE’s national oil giant, which is unabashedly doubling down on oil and gas. It has plans to invest some $150bn by 2027 to expand its production capacity from 4m barrels per day today to 5m. (It also funded Mr Jaber’s education in America; he holds degrees from two California universities.)

The world must deal with greenhouse-gas emissions, he acknowledges. But he also points out that it currently heavily relies on fossil fuels and needs more to meet the needs of the developing world. So he wants continued investment in low-cost oil reserves of the sort found in abundance in the Persian Gulf. Along with Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s even bigger state-run petro-goliath, ADNOC intends to be the last man standing in the oil endgame.

Surprisingly, Mr Jaber is also a clean-energy pioneer in the UAE. Back in 2006 he helped found Masdar, a renewable-energy company in which ADNOC has a stake. Masdar is spending $35bn to expand green power-generation capacity globally from 20GW in 2022 to 100GW in 2030, which would make it the world’s second-biggest developer of clean energy. ADNOC is also promoting the development of technologies like carbon capture and sequestration to abate emissions from fossil-burning.

None of this matters much to such climate provocateurs as Greta Thunberg and Al Gore, who have already denounced the Dubai gathering as a farce. It may well fall flat, as some [previous COP meetings have](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/24/cop27-was-disappointing-but-us-china-climate-diplomacy-is-thawing). But if Mr Jaber can get the oil and gas industry to agree to meaningful curbs on emissions of greenhouse gases like methane, he will prove that the ideal need not be the enemy of the good.
