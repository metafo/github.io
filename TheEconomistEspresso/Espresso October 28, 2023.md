Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

In a televised press conference Binyamin Netanyahu, **Israel’s** prime minister, announced that the **Israel Defence Forces** had entered a second phase of the war in Gaza. He warned of a “long and difficult” operation in the coastal enclave to “dismantle” Hamas and free hostages. Earlier Yoav Gallant, the defence minister, said “the earth in [Gaza](https://web.archive.org/web/20231029100200/https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/10/17/israel-gaza-map-hamas-war) shook” on Friday night when the IDF entered the enclave and attacked Hamas, striking “above ground and underground”. Since then internet and phone services in the strip have been down, although there are reports that some connectivity may be returning.

**Protesters** gathered in cities across the world to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Tens of thousands [demonstrated](https://web.archive.org/web/20231029100200/https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/28/the-culture-war-over-the-gaza-war) in London; thousands more marched in New York and New Zealand. Addressing a pro-Palestinian rally in Istanbul, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, characterised Israel’s strikes as “a massacre”, criticised Western leaders and urged the Muslim world to unite. Israel withdrew some diplomats from Istanbul in protest.

**Mike Pence**, a former vice-president, pulled out of America’s 2024 presidential race. He announced the end of his bid during a speech at the annual conference of the Republican Jewish Coalition, a gathering of big conservative donors. Like other hopefuls, Mr Pence lagged in the polls behind his former running-mate, Donald Trump, who has for months dominated the race for the 2024 [Republican](https://web.archive.org/web/20231029100200/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/26/the-republican-party-no-longer-believes-america-is-the-essential-nation) nomination.

The **United Automobile Workers** union reached a tentative agreement on a new workers’ contract with **Stellantis**, a carmaker. The deal includes a 25% pay increase for over four-and-a-half years. On October 25th UAW agreed similar new terms with Ford. More than 45,000 workers have been striking against Detroit’s “[big three](https://web.archive.org/web/20231029100200/https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/20/americas-big-car-firms-face-lengthy-strikes)” carmakers for over six weeks. The union expanded its strike against **General Motors** to include an engine plant.

A police officer was killed, and more than 100 people were injured, at a protest in Dhaka, **Bangladesh’s** capital. Tens of thousands of people had gathered to demand the resignation of [Sheikh Hasina](https://web.archive.org/web/20231029100200/https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/24/sheikh-hasina-is-asias-iron-lady), the prime minister. The rally was organised by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, an opposition group which is calling for elections in January to be held under a neutral caretaker government.

Reports suggested that **Joe Biden** and **Xi Jinping** have agreed to meet during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco in November. Quoting an unnamed American official, the Associated Press said the details of the summit were still under discussion. There has been a series of high-level meetings between Chinese and American officials recently, suggesting that testy relations between the countries are warming—[at least a bit](https://web.archive.org/web/20231029100200/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/10/12/chinas-ties-with-america-are-warming-a-bit).

**South Africa** beat New Zealand 12-11 in the final of the [**Rugby World Cup**](https://web.archive.org/web/20231029100200/https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/09/15/many-sports-are-adopting-a-more-flexible-approach-to-national-identity), giving the Springboks a record fourth title. Siya Kolisi, who four years ago in Japan became the first black captain of South Africa to lift the trophy, repeated the feat in France. A sport once associated with the white side of apartheid is now a source of [pride](https://web.archive.org/web/20231029100200/https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/22/rugby-brings-south-africa-together-if-only-for-80-minutes) across the Rainbow Nation.

### A long crisis in Gaza

On October 27th the Israel Defence Forces entered Gaza. The incursion seemed bigger than the raids of the previous two nights. Locations of entry—north and south of Gaza city, the enclave’s largest urban area—suggest a gradual plan to encircle it. One senior officer says the ground offensive could take a year. Such a slow campaign would rely on siege tactics, in part to limit Hamas’s access to fuel, which powers the generators for its tunnels. Israel, which still refuses to allow fuel into Gaza, sees its blockade a military necessity.

For civilians, though, it is a source of misery. Dozens of [hospitals](https://www.economist.com/interactive/the-economist-explains/2023/10/20/what-evidence-reveals-about-the-gaza-hospital-blasts-source) and clinics have closed, as have most bakeries. Much of the water infrastructure is offline too, forcing people to drink brackish well water. Doctors fear poor sanitation will spread disease. Even the food coming across the border is no help: families do not have enough water or fuel to cook the rice and lentils now available. Time to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe is running out.

### Turkey’s next 100 years

Kemal Ataturk has been dead for more than 80 years. Yet he is still Turkey’s most popular politician. He drove out an invading Greek army and abolished the Ottoman sultanate that had ruled Turkey for 600 years. On Sunday, Turks will celebrate the [100th anniversary](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/26/instead-of-undoing-ataturks-legacy-recep-tayyip-erdogan-has-claimed-it) of Ataturk’s founding of the Turkish republic.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s current president, is often viewed as the anti-Ataturk. In his two decades in power Mr Erodgan has chipped away at the reforms instituted by his secular-minded predecessor. He has empowered a generation of pious businesspeople, lifted restrictions on headscarves worn by religious women and promoted Islamic education.

But the strongman has also co-opted and redefined his predecessor’s legacy. Mr Erdogan celebrates Ataturk’s nationalism rather than his secularism. Unlike Ataturk, he has a positive view of Turkey’s Ottoman past. That fits with his vision of a new “Turkish century”, which combines strategic autonomy from the West with economic expansion. All this has broad appeal. It may endure, even after Mr Erdogan is gone.

### A battery renaissance

Batteries are both invisible and important: most users notice them only when they stop working. But everything electrical or electronic relies on them in one form or another, so the introduction of a new type of battery is a big deal.

[Sodium-ion (Na-ion)](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/10/25/firms-are-exploring-sodium-batteries-as-an-alternative-to-lithium) batteries have a similar chemistry to the lithium-ion (Li-ion) sort, which have made consumer electronics better and electric cars possible. But sodium is cheaper than lithium, and batteries made using it do not require expensive nickel and cobalt, as the best Li-ion ones do. On the other hand, Na-ion batteries are heavier than their Li-ion equivalents, limiting their deployability. Firms in China—where the government’s five-year economic plan includes exploring a variety of battery chemistries—are working hard on them. Battery-makers elsewhere, less so.

How things will play out depends on economic and technological variables. But the batteries’ mere existence will stimulate competition and help propel widespread electrification.

### How the vinyl revival was hijacked

When on October 20th the [Rolling Stones](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/08/25/charlie-wattss-drumming-style-helped-define-the-rolling-stones-sound) released “Hackney Diamonds”, the band’s first original album in almost two decades, many acolytes bought it [on vinyl](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/10/18/the-strange-revival-of-vinyl-records)—an old format befitting an old act. The vinyl revival, now well into its second decade, crosses generations and genres. In America, 25- to 34-year-olds buy as many vinyl records as the over-55s.

Last year [Taylor Swift](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/25/can-superstars-like-beyonce-or-taylor-swift-spur-inflation) sold almost 1m copies of “Midnights” on vinyl; in August Travis Scott’s “Utopia” moved more vinyl copies in a single week than any [rap album](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/08/10/hip-hops-future-will-be-less-american-and-more-global) since data-collection began in 1991. As listeners drop CDs for streaming services, vinyl sales keep spinning. The market was valued at $1.7bn last year; by 2028 it is expected to be worth $2.8bn.

But production, crunched during the pandemic, lags behind growing demand. And as star artists flock to the profit and prestige of vinyl, small record shops and independent labels are being squeezed out of the format they helped to reinvigorate.

### Weekend profile: Muhammad al-Emadi, Qatar’s envoy to Gaza

For five years [Qatar](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/22/are-the-abraham-accords-over) sent Muhammad al-Emadi to bankroll Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist organisation that runs Gaza. Once a month, the Qatari envoy and construction magnate would pack three suitcases with $100 bills, load them onto his private jet in Doha, the capital, and fly to Ben Gurion airport in Israel. At HaKiriya, Israel’s defence ministry in Tel Aviv, he would chat with commanders while they inspected his suitcases, then drive an hour down the coast, crossing into Gaza. Settled into his tiled villa in Gaza city, and sporting his Gulf white *thobe*, he would hand over the money.

Flatterers in Hamas praised Mr Emadi as Gaza’s de facto president. The cash he doled out served several purposes: some went towards basic infrastructure; some towards welfare handouts for around 100,000 people, including the injured from Israel’s earlier bombardments; and some towards salary payments, of $400 a head, for Hamas officials. Over the years, his monthly payments increased from $15m to $30m. By some estimates Israel co-ordinated Qatar’s payment of over $1.5bn to Hamas-controlled Gaza.

The arrangement, in effect, split the Palestinian polity between the West Bank, ruled by Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority and backed by the West; and Gaza, the Qatari-funded Islamist statelet run by Hamas. This division appealed to Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, because it helped [him stave off pressure](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/08/the-lessons-from-hamass-assault-on-israel) to negotiate over creating a single Palestinian state.

It was always risky: a shortfall in payments might prompt Hamas to release fire balloons, setting Israeli farmland ablaze, or throw stones at Mr Emadi’s convoy. But as soon as the funds flowed again, quiet would resume. While Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant organisation, launched rockets, Hamas held fire.

In May, however, the funds dwindled sharply. Islamist politicians warned Mr Emadi that they were losing what sway they still had over the commander of Hamas’s military wing, [Muhammad Deif](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/20/hamass-deadly-phantom-the-man-behind-the-attacks). On October 7th, Hamas broke out of its cage.

Mr Emadi has not given up trying to tame Hamas. From his Doha office, he has negotiated the release of four hostages. He maintains the prospect of a truce, even a deal. “Qatar’s diplomatic efforts are crucial,” tweeted Israel’s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, on Friday.

Other Israelis, though, see Mr Emadi as a terrorism financier. “Satan,” spat one normally sober Israeli mediator. An Israeli official warns that Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, will soon begin hunting Hamas and its abettors—possibly in Doha, where Hamas is based abroad. The bankroller might worry.
