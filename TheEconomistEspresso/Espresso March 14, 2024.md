Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**America’**s House of Representatives approved a bill that would force **TikTok**’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app to an owner of another nationality. Otherwise it will face a ban in America, [TikTok](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/12/time-for-tiktok-to-cut-its-ties-to-china)’s largest market. Regulators worry that **China** is using the app to gather Americans’ personal data. Moreover, because TikTok is increasingly a source of news, they fear that it could be used as a tool of propaganda. The bipartisan measure passed 352-65, although its fate in the Senate is uncertain.

**Vladimir Putin** warned the West that Russia was ready for a nuclear war “from a military-technical point of view”, and warned America against deploying troops to Ukraine. He said that a recent spate of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil facilities was designed to disrupt Russia’s presidential “election”. That three-day vote, which begins on Friday, is guaranteed to hand Mr Putin another six years in power.

**Rishi Sunak**, Britain’s prime minister, plans to change the law to prevent foreign governments from owning [British newspapers](https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/03/06/what-the-softening-of-the-sun-says-about-britain). The law would threaten the planned takeover of the **Telegraph Media Group**—owner of the *Spectator* and the *Telegraph* newspapers—by RedBird IMI, a firm backed by the Abu Dhabi government. The government announced the plan in a House of Lords debate.

**Geert Wilders**, whose anti-immigrant Freedom Party won the most votes in the **Dutch** election in November, appeared to take himself out of the running for prime minister. Mr Wilders, who is still struggling to form a coalition, suggested on X that he would abandon his bid since not all parties supported it. He said he wants the Netherlands to have a “right-wing cabinet”.

A **Ukrainian** drone strike caused a fire at the Ryazan oil refinery near Moscow, one of Russia’s biggest crude-processing facilities. A site in the southern Rostov region was also hit. Both halted operations. Ukraine has [stepped up](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/10/a-report-from-near-ukraines-southern-front) its attacks on critical infrastructure in recent months. On Tuesday it launched strikes targeting energy sites in at least seven **Russian** regions.

The **European Parliament** passed the [AI Act](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/10/europe-a-laggard-in-ai-seizes-the-lead-in-its-regulation), a law on regulating artificial intelligence. The EU is the first influential regulator to approve a big law on AI. The rules will subject the most powerful **large language models**, including ChatGPT, to stricter rules, such as mandates to assess risks and to take measures to mitigate them. It will also ban most uses of real-time facial recognition.

A **Japanese** rocket launched by Space One exploded on its maiden voyage seconds after launch. The solid-fuelled *Kairos*, which was carrying a government intelligence satellite, lifted off from the Kii spaceport in the western part of the country. Space One had hoped to become the first [private](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/02/15/a-private-moon-mission-hopes-to-succeed-where-others-have-failed) Japanese company to send a satellite into orbit.

### Foxconn’s next chapter

Foxconn, one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, is often regarded as a gauge of economic activity in [China](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/15/china-may-be-losing-its-sway-over-taiwanese-business), where its largest factories are located. Some analysts also look to its production lines for a sense of how Apple, the American technology giant, is performing. Foxconn’s factories churn out more iPhones than any other company’s. But the Taiwanese group, which just celebrated its 50th anniversary, is trying to shift what it makes and where it makes it.

Analysts looking at Foxconn’s fourth-quarter results, released on Thursday, will therefore also be trying to get a sense of the company’s direction as it moves beyond making phones in China. The group is investing heavily in India and, on a more limited scale, in America. It is also starting to produce more electric vehicles. Those changes will, in turn, change how the company copes with the complicated politics of Taiwanese-Chinese-American relations.

### NATO’s secretary-general steps down

After ten years in the job Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general, will deliver his final annual report on Thursday. He leaves the military alliance in good shape. But it is facing great challenges. Because of Vladimir Putin’s aggression against Ukraine, NATO has rediscovered its role as the bastion of European territorial defence against Russia.

Last week, Sweden joined Finland as a new NATO member. Both countries bring sophisticated military capabilities to defending NATO’s border in the Baltics and in the high north. Roughly two-thirds of NATO’s 32 members are on track this year to reach or exceed the target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. And the alliance is currently conducting its biggest exercise since the cold war, involving 90,000 troops.

But the failure to deliver sufficient munitions to Ukraine has allowed Russia, for now, to take the advantage in the war. Perhaps most worrying is the possibility of NATO-hating Donald Trump returning to the White House and effectively taking America out of the alliance.

### Spain votes on an amnesty for Catalan separatists

On Thursday the lower house of Spain’s parliament will vote on an amnesty for hundreds of people involved in an illegal referendum in 2017 held in a failed push for Catalan independence.

The issue has consumed Spanish politics since last summer. Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister, fell short of a majority in an election in July. To [secure the votes](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/09/spains-prime-minister-secures-his-job-at-a-high-cost) of Catalan separatists in parliament he proposed an amnesty—an idea he had previously called unconstitutional. The political right, and many of Mr Sánchez’s fellow Socialists, are outraged by the volte-face. Parliament rejected a previous version of the deal in January. The Catalan separatist leaders who stand to benefit have neither apologised for their actions nor promised not to try again. But Mr Sánchez exercises tight control over his party and has now secured the votes he needs from other parties.

An amnesty would eventually allow Carles Puigdemont—the former president of the regional government of Catalonia, exiled in Belgium since 2017—to return. Whether it would heal wounds is another matter.

### How global shipping is faring

Globalisation’s middlemen have had a testing start to 2024. Low waters stalled freighters trying to pass through the [Panama Canal](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/01/09/the-dwindling-of-the-panama-canal-boosts-rival-trade-routes). Attacks by the Houthis, an [Iran-backed Yemeni militia](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/12/who-are-the-houthis-the-group-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea), on ships in the Red Sea shook global trade. The IMF reports that volumes shipped via the Suez Canal—which normally serves around 15% of maritime trade—fell by half in January and February compared with a year earlier. Most have been redirected around southern Africa.

DP World’s results on Thursday may indicate how these disruptions are affecting global trade. The [state-owned Emirati firm](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/23/the-messier-the-world-gets-the-more-the-uae-seems-to-thrive) operates ports in roughly 40 countries. In January its boss, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, seemed unconcerned about the Houthis’ attacks. “I don’t see this going on long term,” he said. Two months later the Red Sea shows no sign of returning to normal. With container lines complaining of congestion at ports in Europe and Asia, Mr bin Sulayem will hope to reassure customers that DP World can weather the storm.

### Why golfers are feeling flush

Since the launch of the Saudi-funded LIV Tour two years ago, men’s golf has been soaked in money. LIV offered enormous salaries to some of the world’s best players to persuade them to defect from America’s prestigious [PGA Tour](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/06/07/the-pga-agrees-to-team-up-with-its-golfing-arch-enemy). Those offers continue to lure them: Tyrrell Hatton, an English player, moved to LIV in January for a reported sum of at least $60m.

The PGA Tour responded by jacking up the prize money at its own events. This year’s Players Championship at Sawgrass in Florida, which begins on Thursday, carries a total purse of $25m, making it more lucrative than any of the four majors. The tour also accepted a $3bn investment from Strategic Sports Group, an American consortium, creating a new commercial entity. Crucially, to encourage their loyalty players will get equity stakes in this venture. Golfers are already among the best-paid athletes on the planet. They are about to get richer still.
