Vladimir Putin said that Russian security services had arrested four men who carried out a [terror attack on a concert hall](https://web.archive.org/web/20240323231026/https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/22/who-was-behind-the-massacre-in-moscow) near Moscow. The men are understood to be among a total of 11 people detained in connection with Friday’s attack, which killed at least 133 people and wounded many more. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the rampage, sharing an image of the perpetrators on Telegram, a messaging platform. American officials, who warned Russia of an imminent attack two weeks ago, said they had no reason to doubt the claim’s credibility.

The attack is the worst terrorist incident to take place in Russia for decades. In his address, Mr Putin made no mention of Islamic State’s involvement. Promising to “punish everyone who stands behind the terrorists”, he tried to connect the attackers to Ukraine and claimed they were captured while fleeing to the border. Ukraine firmly denied any involvement. Dmytro Kuleba, the country’s foreign minister, dismissed Mr Putin’s remarks as a “provocation” designed “to further fuel anti-Ukrainian hysteria”.

America’s Congress [passed](https://web.archive.org/web/20240323231026/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/23/winners-and-losers-as-america-at-last-reaches-a-budget-deal) a $1.2trn bipartisan spending package that will fund the government until October, sending it to President Joe Biden to sign into law and averting a government shutdown. The House passed the vote earlier in the day, but the Senate was delayed for hours by haggling over controversial amendments.

Speaking at the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza, António Guterres said it was “time to truly flood [Gaza](https://web.archive.org/web/20240323231026/https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/03/21/the-war-in-gaza-may-topple-hamas-without-making-israel-safer) with life-saving aid”. The UN secretary-general, who stood alongside a queue of halted trucks, renewed his plea for a ceasefire and called on Israel to allow more aid to enter the enclave. [Food shortages](https://web.archive.org/web/20240323231026/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/08/will-joe-bidens-new-plan-bring-relief-to-gaza) in the territory have worsened in recent weeks.

America’s Federal Aviation Administration is considering preventing United Airlines from adding new routes and taking paying passengers on new aircraft, Bloomberg reported. The regulator is said to be concerned about several recent incidents involving the carrier. One plane ran off a taxiway; another shed a tyre soon after takeoff.

India’s navy completed an anti-piracy mission east of the Red Sea and returned to Mumbai, where they handed over 35 [Somali pirates](https://web.archive.org/web/20240323231026/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/21/somali-pirates-are-staging-a-comeback) to local police. The men face prosecution under an Indian law, passed in 2022, which allows the navy to apprehend pirates in international waters. Somali pirates have completed or attempted more than 20 hijackings since November.

With a general election set to begin next month, India’s government said it will extend an export ban—previously due to expire on March 31st—on [onions](https://web.archive.org/web/20240323231026/https://www.economist.com/business/2013/12/14/lords-of-the-rings). The policy has lowered the vegetable’s price in local markets, but the announcement could make international traders weep. Importers in Bangladesh, Malaysia and the UAE have faced high prices since the ban was introduced in December.

### The IMF’s advice to China

On Sunday the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, who this month won crucial European backing for a second term, gave a speech to the China Development Forum, a jabfest for foreign investors and businessmen in Beijing. The fund and China agree on some things, including the dangers of trade wars and decoupling (which the IMF calls “geoeconomic fragmentation”).

Still, Ms Georgieva said China had reached “a fork in the road” and must choose to focus on “pro-market reforms”. To boost growth, the IMF thinks [China](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/14/chinas-economic-bright-spots-provide-a-warning) should cut interest rates (even if that entails a cheaper yuan) and redirect its stimulus spending from public investment to the social safety-net. It should also be more decisive in cleaning up the debts of property developers, local governments and distressed sovereign borrowers like Sri Lanka and Zambia.

Some foreigners think the fund should be even tougher on China. They want it to express alarm about the country’s growing trade surpluses, especially in electric vehicles, which threaten rival manufacturers around the world.

### Senegal’s long-awaited election

Little more than a month ago Senegal was in the midst of a [constitutional crisis](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/04/senegals-democracy-hangs-by-a-thread). Macky Sall, the departing president, had tried to delay elections by ten months. His [most popular rival](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/25/how-to-nobble-a-political-rival-in-africa-and-get-away-with-it) was behind bars and disqualified from running. Security forces were beating and arresting protesters. Many feared that a country widely seen as a bulwark of stability in the region was now going the same way as all those others beset by bloody [coups and overstaying presidents](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/03/africas-coups-are-part-of-a-far-bigger-crisis).

So it is with relief that citizens of one of Africa’s most vibrant democracies finally go to the polls on Sunday. Senegal’s constitutional court slapped down Mr Sall’s bid to postpone them, and his opponents have since been released from prison. Of the 19 contenders now on the ballot at least three are real contenders to succeed Mr Sall, who is not running. A vote many feared might not happen is instead set to be a nail-biter.

### NFL franchises are too big to buy

NFL American football teams are the most valuable sports clubs on the planet. According to Sportico, a sports analysis company, 12 of the top 20 belong to the league. Their success in selling out stadiums and attracting the biggest sports broadcasting deal in history has made NFL owners extraordinarily rich. But it has also created a big problem. So valuable are the NFL franchises that it has become very difficult to find anyone with deep enough pockets to buy them.

At the owners’ latest pow-wow, which begins on Saturday in Florida, loosening the league’s strict investment rules (the lead owner needs to control at least 30%, among other stipulations) could thus be up for discussion. In 2022 the National Basketball Association relaxed its rules to permit private-equity firms to buy up to 20% of a team and sovereign wealth funds to own up to 5%. The NFL is unlikely to go so far immediately, but the sale of passive stakes to local investors is increasingly likely in the long run.

### Intermittent fasting may strain the heart

Intermittent fasting is a broad church. Its practitioners range from occasional breakfast-skippers to committed clock-watchers, who proselytise the diet’s weight-loss benefits. In fairness, some studies have backed these claims—but only with respect to short-term effects. Now, the first long-term study of intermittent fasting has cast doubt on its supposed health-giving qualities.

The study, by a Chinese team and presented at a conference of the American Heart Association, analysed data from 20,000 American adults over a median of eight years. It found that those who reported eating only within an eight-hour daily window had a 91% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease.

The research, however, has not been peer reviewed and did not investigate why restricted mealtimes might contribute to worse heart health. This omission, among other limitations, means that the study is unlikely to bring any hardcore fasters to the breakfast table. For now then, intermittent fasting will remain the subject of (early) dinnertime debates.

### Weekend profile: María Corina Machado, Venezuela’s opposition leader

Long dismissed as too radical, too outspoken and way too posh to get anywhere in Venezuelan politics, María Corina Machado has spent the past year proving her critics wrong. She won an opposition primary last October by a landslide and [would roundly defeat](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/06/29/if-venezuelas-elections-were-fair-this-would-be-the-front-runner) Nicolás Maduro, the country’s authoritarian president, in a fair election. So would almost anyone, of course—but for Ms Machado the revenge would be especially sweet.

For decades she has been one of the fiercest critics of *chavismo*, the leftist populist movement set up by the late Hugo Chávez. His corruption and cronyism spawned the disastrous collapse of the Venezuelan economy under Mr Maduro, his chosen successor. In 2012 Ms Machado achieved iconic status among conservatives by calling out *chavismo*’s failings on live television, to Chávez’s face. In the national assembly, Ms Machado, then a congresswoman, interrupted an interminable speech by Chávez to suggest that his policy of expropriating private businesses would be better described as “theft”. The president’s boorish response was that debating her was entirely beneath him. The interaction aged appallingly for *chavismo*, while Ms Machado has been proved right.

A qualified industrial engineer, mother of three and daughter of a wealthy industrialist—whose steel factories were expropriated (and then mismanaged to destruction) by the Chávez government—Ms Machado is a firm believer in free markets. Most of the 56-year-old’s economic policies could be described as centre-right.

The Maduro regime portrays her as a merciless extremist, citing her support for American sanctions and falsely claiming that she backed American military intervention against Venezuela. In June 2023 it banned her from politics for 15 years, and upheld that decision after she won the primary in October. Since then, it has also begun persecuting those who work with her. So far nine of her party workers have been arrested for allegedly planning to organise street violence. Ms Machado, whose political slogan is “hasta el final”—until the end—has promised that none of the regime’s intimidation tactics will ever faze her.
