## The world in brief

### January 12, 2024

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**America** and **Britain** launched joint military strikes against **Houthi** militias in **Yemen**, marking a dramatic escalation in the conflict in the Red Sea. The Iran-backed groups have launched dozens of attacks on ships with drones and missiles, ignoring a warning last week from America and 12 of its allies to end their [attacks](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/04/why-yemens-houthis-are-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea) or face “consequences”.

**South Africa** presented its case before the UN’s International Court of Justice [accusing](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/10/how-the-term-genocide-is-misused-in-the-israel-hamas-war) **Israel** of committing **genocide** in the Gaza Strip. Referring to the Genocide Convention of 1948, lawyers asserted that the “intent” to destroy Gaza had been “nurtured at the highest level of state”. Israel argues that it is fighting a war of self-defence against Hamas after the militant group’s attacks on October 7th. It will vehemently deny the charges in court on Friday.

**Iran** seized an **oil tanker** in the Gulf of Oman. The Greek-owned ship, which is carrying Iraqi oil, was previously at the centre of a dispute with **America** when it transported [Iranian oil](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/25/america-would-struggle-to-break-irans-oil-smuggling-complex) in breach of sanctions. Iranian media said the action was “in retaliation for the theft of oil” by America, which seized the vessel and its oil last year.

**Inflation** in **America** accelerated in December, with consumer prices [increasing](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/10/has-team-transitory-really-won-americas-inflation-debate) at an annual rate of 3.4%. That is a faster pace than in November, when the same rate was 3.1%, though the core measure—which removes volatile food and energy costs—slowed slightly. The Federal Reserve has signalled it will lower interest rates this year as price rises gradually slow.

**American** officials failed to adequately track about $1bn worth of military aid sent to **Ukraine,** a Pentagon report concluded. The materiel was subject to special monitoring, which usually applies to certain missiles and night vision devices. Although improper tracking “may increase the risk of theft”, the report’s authors did not look for evidence of weapons going missing. Congress is currently torn on sending Ukraine more aid.

**Chesapeake Energy**, an American gas firm, has announced it will buy its rival, **Southwestern Energy**, in a $7.4bn all-stock deal. The agreement, which follows a [wave of consolidation](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/11/why-exxonmobil-is-paying-60bn-for-pioneer) in America’s energy sector, will make Chesapeake into one of the largest US gas producers if approved by regulators. The acquisition reflects Chesapeake’s drive to specialise exclusively in natural gas.

Executives at two **Russian** airlines asked officials to extend the service life of Antonov planes, many of which were built in Kyiv in the 1960s. The companies are struggling to maintain capacity without spare parts for planes built by foreign manufacturers, which are unavailable due to [Western sanctions](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/03/05/western-sanctions-on-russia-are-like-none-the-world-has-seen). Nearly 100 Antonov planes are still in service across the country.

### Deflation haunts China’s economy

China will release a bundle of economic data on Friday, offering an insight into the sluggish performance of the world’s second-largest economy in 2023. Data on inflation—or rather, deflation—will be among the figures. While the rest of the world has struggled to bring inflation down from the high levels seen in 2023, Chinese consumer prices fell by 0.5% year-on-year in November. Prices are expected to keep falling—the result of weak consumer demand, triggered by the downturn in the country’s property market.

Closely watched data on trade in December are also on the way. With a flagging [domestic economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/10/does-china-face-a-lost-decade), China’s leaders are juicing the manufacturing sector with credit from the country’s state-owned banks. Exports slumped in 2023 as a result of a post-pandemic hangover in electronic goods. Economists expect export growth of about 1.7% year-on-year, the strongest rise in eight months.

### Goldilocks and the three bank scenarios

America’s biggest lenders—including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo—are reporting earnings on Friday. The main news is likely to be a peaking of net-interest income, ie, the difference between what banks collect on loans and pay on their funding. After climbing every quarter from $45bn at the start of 2021 to $64bn last quarter, analysts now forecast that NII will begin to decline.

The earnings reports should also provide clues about [the economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/10/has-team-transitory-really-won-americas-inflation-debate)—it might still be too hot. As consumers have gone shopping, reported credit-card balances have climbed. A sharp rise in charge-offs (for failed loans) would suggest that a recession looms. Ideally, the economy is not so strong that the Fed might delay cutting rates or even keep raising them, which caused bank failures and a spike in funding costs in early 2023; but not so weak that borrowers begin defaulting en masse. Bankers need things “just right”.

### Supersonic flight returns, quietly

On Friday NASA will unveil its X-59 Quesst aircraft, which is a test bed for a possible supersonic passenger plane. [Supersonic travel](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/12/19/a-new-type-of-jet-engine-could-revive-supersonic-air-travel) has been a thing of the past since Concorde, an Anglo-French jet, stopped flying in 2003. Concorde proved expensive to run, partly because its “sonic boom” was thought too loud for built-up areas, which limited the routes it could fly. The X-59 is slower than Concorde, with a cruising speed of about Mach 1.4 (roughly 1,500 kilometres per hour) compared with Concorde’s Mach 2. But its “quiet supersonic technology”—from which it takes its “Quesst” name—is meant to produce a gentler sonic “thump” that is less jarring to those on the ground.

Test flights are due to start later this year. And NASA is not the only outfit keen to revive supersonic air travel. Boom Supersonic, an American firm, also hopes to make the first flight of its prototype aircraft in the coming months.

### Hiking gear and price hikes in Milan

Milan men’s fashion week starts on Friday. Over four days posh designers such as Fendi, Prada and JW Anderson will present their autumn and winter collections for this year to buyers, stylists, publicists and journalists—plus a smattering of celebrities and influencers.

Sabato De Sarno, Gucci’s creative director since early 2023, will open the extravaganza with his first menswear collection for the label. In line with the popular “gorpcore” trend—where outdoorsy hiking garments are worn as streetwear—Stone Island, a high-tech Italian outerwear brand, will put on its first-ever runway show. Stone Island was bought by the Moncler group in a deal worth a reported €1.15bn ($1.4bn) in 2020, and is loved by football hooligans and hypebeasts alike.

The pressure is on designers to pull in the customers. McKinsey, a consultancy, estimates that more than half of fashion brands intend to raise their prices [this year](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/dont-count-on-a-soft-landing-for-the-world-economy), as the industry pushes against inflation, declining consumer confidence and shrinking household savings.

### Chinese football and the Asian Cup

If all had gone to plan, football fans would have flocked to China’s stadiums in 2023. The country was meant to host the Asian Cup, a regional tournament held every four years. Players will instead kick off in an air-conditioned arena in Qatar on Friday. China relinquished hosting rights in 2022 after its zero-covid policy delayed preparations. Qatar, fresh from throwing a World Cup, has stepped in.

It is one of several recent footballing failures in China. Chinese football officials have been accused of corruption. Overseas stars have been returning home, sometimes unpaid. And the national team has had little success. Hong Kong—the lowest-ranked team at the Asian Cup, having qualified for the first time since 1968—beat China in a friendly on January 1st.

Xi Jinping, a lifelong fan of [the sport](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/24/how-an-amateur-football-league-in-china-took-off), wants his country to become a footballing superpower. Mr Xi published a 50-point plan for growing the game in 2015. But even the football-mad president recently admitted that he was “not so sure” about the standard of China’s players.
