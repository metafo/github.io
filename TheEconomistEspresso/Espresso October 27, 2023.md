## The world in brief

### October 27, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



The **Israel Defense Forces** said they carried out a “targeted raid” on Thursday in northern Gaza, using tanks and infantry units, in “preparation for the next stages of combat”. **Hamas’s** military wing said that “almost 50” hostages, abducted during its [attack on Israel](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas) on October 7th, have been killed by Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip—a claim that has not been independently verified. Meanwhile, an official at the World Health Organisation said that Gaza’s humanitarian crisis had reached “catastrophic proportions”. Just 12 lorries managed to deliver aid to the enclave overnight, according to the Red Crescent.

**America’s** GDP grew at an annual rate of 4.9% in the third quarter, up from 2.1% in the second quarter and the fastest rate in almost two years. The economy [remains strong](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/23/americas-astonishing-economic-growth-goes-up-another-gear) despite high interest rates, buoyed by robust consumer spending and higher wages. But the scorching pace may eventually slow, as bond yields continue to rise.

**Maine’s** governor said that 18 people were killed and 13 injured in mass shootings at a restaurant and bowling alley in Lewiston, the state’s second-largest city. Hundreds of police officers continued to search for Robert Card, who was issued an arrest warrant for murder. Residents of several cities were warned to shelter at home. In 2022 there were just 29 murders in Maine.

**Sudan’s** warring factions resumed American- and Saudi-brokered peace talks, in Jeddah, a city in Saudi Arabia. Negotiations between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces broke down in July. Around 9,000 civilians have reportedly been killed since the conflict started [in April](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/19/after-six-months-of-civil-war-little-remains-of-khartoum), though this is probably an underestimate. More than 5.6m people have been driven from their homes.

Residents in Guerrero, a state in southern Mexico, continued to feel the effects of **Hurricane Otis**, which ravaged through the coastal state. The hurricane made landfall on Wednesday as a [category-five storm](https://www.economist.com/films/2023/05/05/the-science-behind-the-perfect-storm)—the strongest on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. Residents of Acapulco, a resort city of almost one million people, lost power and internet connection. At least 27 people died because of the storm.

The **European Central Bank** left interest rates unchanged, after ten consecutive increases. Inflation in the [euro zone](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/31/europes-economy-looks-to-be-heading-for-trouble) is falling: it was 4.3% in the year to September, down from 5.2% in August. But Christine Lagarde, the bank’s president, suggested it was too soon to consider cutting rates. The deposit rate currently stands at a record

David Kirke, one of the performers of the world’s first modern-day **bungee jump**, died aged 78. He founded Oxford’s Dangerous Sports Club, which invented and tested extreme activities. Inspired by a ritual carried out in Vanuatu, Mr Kirke jumped off the Clifton suspension bridge, a 76m structure in Bristol, dressed in a top hat and tails and holding a bottle of champagne.

### Figure of the day: 

**6.1m**, the population of Paraguay, according to its recent census. The figure is confounding statisticians, who expected one million more inhabitants. [Read the full story.](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/10/26/over-a-million-paraguayans-disappear-in-the-latest-census)

### Republicans unite over Israel

When Donald Trump criticised Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, after Hamas’s attack on October 7th, something unusual happened: his rivals in the Republican presidential primary promptly denounced him. Even more uncharacteristically, he backtracked. Mr Trump will speak alongside his opponents at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s leadership summit, which begins on Friday. His team will undoubtedly think carefully about his tone. The divided Republicans appear to have found some unity in their support of Israel.

Less so the Democrats. [President Joe Biden](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/17/biden-steers-a-risky-course-in-the-israel-hamas-war)’s staunch defence of Israel was initially welcomed by his party—and most still support that view. But Israel’s intensifying bombing campaign in Gaza has angered progressives in Congress. They called for Israel to end its blockade of food, water and fuel into Gaza. In the House of Representatives some advocated for a ceasefire. Feeling the heat, Mr Biden asked Israel to protect Gazan civilians. With an Israeli ground invasion nearing, worried progressives may take more placating.

### Bigger oil, shorter bets

ExxonMobil and Chevron, American [oil giants](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/19/why-big-oil-is-beefing-up-its-trading-arms), report quarterly earnings on Friday. The industry’s mood is sombre. On Tuesday the International Energy Agency, an official forecaster, said that global oil demand will peak by 2030. Despite the war in the Middle East, oil prices have not rocketed. Results will be disappointing compared with last year’s record profits.

But two big deals are cheering investors. ExxonMobil is buying Pioneer Natural Resources for $60bn, which will make the oil major the largest producer in America’s shale-oil patch. Chevron is spending $53bn to buy Hess, which has a stake in Guyana, the world’s most promising new oil producer.

These deals set the firms up well for the [energy transition](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/28/can-europes-power-grid-cope-with-the-green-transition). That is because they involve “short-cycle” oil, which can be brought on and taken off the market quickly and relatively cheaply. Unlike traditional oil-exploration efforts, such projects do not lock up capital for a decade or more. Despite the prospect of ebbing demand, Big Oil may soon become Enormous Oil.

### Twitter’s first year under Elon Musk

“This is not a way to sort of make money,” said Elon Musk last year, before he bought Twitter. He was right. During Mr Musk’s first year in charge, the social network, which he renamed X, [has shrivelled](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/07/elon-musks-plans-could-hinder-twitternomics). Big advertisers have slashed spending. Less than 1% of users have signed up for an $8-per-month subscription plan. To cut costs, Mr Musk sacked 80% of the [staff](https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/12/02/i-thought-id-been-hacked-it-turned-out-id-been-fired-tales-of-a-twitter-engineer).

The world’s richest man may have set out to do good rather than make a profit. But he has made the platform worse. “Verified” badges go to any paying subscriber, causing confusion. Subscribers’ posts are prioritised in other users’ feeds, crowding out better content. Viral posts are rewarded with a share of ad revenue, encouraging clickbait. X’s skeleton staff struggles to combat misinformation. Mr Musk dismisses criticism from mainstream media. But customers seem to agree with the critics: the number of daily users is down by 13% in the past year.

### Malaysia’s monarchical merry-go-round

On Friday Malaysia’s nine sultans are expected to meet to pick a new king from their midst. Since 1957 the South-East Asian democracy has followed a peculiar process for electing its head of state. In nine of Malaysia’s 13 federal states, a sultan is the titular head of government. They take turns to serve as king for five-year terms.

The most likely candidate is Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar, of the southern state of Johor. The king’s job is largely ceremonial. Yet political upheaval has kept Malaysia’s monarchs busy in recent years. The incumbent, Sultan Abdullah, has appointed three prime ministers since 2019—including [Anwar Ibrahim](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/12/08/which-version-of-anwar-ibrahim-will-govern-malaysia), the current prime minister, who had received a pardon for charges of sodomy and corruption from the previous king.

Older and rural Malays hold royals in high esteem. They may have been disappointed by the previous king, Sultan Muhammad V, who became the first to [abdicate](https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/01/12/malaysias-sultans-must-pick-a-new-king) in 2019 after he married a Russian beauty queen. Many suspected his love life raised too many eyebrows in the conservative country.

### Baseball’s golden season

For the first time in almost 20 years the two best-of-seven-game series to determine the winners of baseball’s National and American leagues went the full distance. The Texas Rangers beat the Houston Astros, the winners of last year’s World Series, to win the American League pennant. The Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the Philadelphia Phillies to top the National League. The two pennant winners will meet in the World Series, another seven-game competition to determine America’s baseball champions, which begins on Friday at the Rangers’ stadium in Arlington. An epic World Series would be a fitting end to a golden year for American baseball.

At the start of this season in March Major League Baseball introduced [rule changes](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/03/24/major-league-baseball-sheds-its-conservatism-and-embraces-fun) to speed up the game. A timer allows pitchers 15 seconds between throws when bases are empty, for example. They have worked. The average length of a nine-inning game has fallen from three hours and four minutes to two hours 40 minutes. And games were more eventful: there were more runs and more stolen bases this year than last. Fans are coming back. Total attendance surpassed 70m for the first time since 2017.
