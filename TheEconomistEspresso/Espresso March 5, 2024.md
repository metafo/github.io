Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

America’s **Supreme Court** unanimously ruled that Colorado [cannot remove](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/09/the-supreme-court-hints-it-will-keep-donald-trump-on-the-ballot) **Donald Trump** from its primary ballot, overturning the state’s earlier decision to kick him off for allegedly participating in insurrection. All nine justices agreed that states could not enforce the relevant constitutional provision—[Section Three](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/20/could-the-14th-amendment-bar-donald-trump-from-becoming-president-again) of the Fourteenth Amendment—against presidential candidates. The ruling, which comes one day before Colorado holds its Republican primary, is sure to quash similar efforts by other states to bar Mr Trump for his role in the January 6th Capitol riot.

**Israel** conducted a six-hour raid in **Ramallah**, the de facto capital of the [West Bank](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/08/a-history-of-settler-violence-in-the-west-bank). The operation was the biggest raid carried out in Ramallah for years and sparked a violent confrontation between Israeli security services and Palestinians. Israeli sources said that the operation led to the arrest of two suspected terrorists. The Palestinian health ministry reported that a 16-year-old boy was killed.

There are “reasonable grounds” to believe that members of **Hamas** raped women during the [attack on October 7th](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas), according to a special envoy for the United Nations. Pramila Patten said she also found evidence that some hostages endured **sexual violence**, including “sexualised torture”. Additionally she asked Israel to allow the UN to investigate sexual-violence allegations from Palestinians implicating Israeli forces and settlers.

**JetBlue Airlines** and **Spirit Airlines** called off a $3.8bn merger, ending almost two years of [negotiations](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/28/the-spirit-deal-is-a-missed-opportunity-for-creative-destruction) between the companies. The deal was sunk by a ruling from America’s Justice Department, which said the merger would harm consumers by removing a low-cost option for air travel. JetBlue’s share price rose following the news, while Spirit’s fell by almost 15%.

The **European Commission** fined **Apple** €1.8bn ($2bn) for breaching competition law. The bloc accused the [American tech giant](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/03/apple-is-right-not-to-rush-headlong-into-generative-ai) of limiting information about other firms’ music-streaming services on its app store and other platforms. The fine is the third-largest that the commission has issued. Apple said it would appeal against the ruling.

**Jack Teixeira**, a 22-year-old member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, pleaded guilty to [leaking hundreds of classified files](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/13/america-arrests-the-suspect-behind-mass-intelligence-leaks) on Discord, a messaging platform. The documents, which he accessed using his top-secret security clearance, included detailed assessments of Ukraine’s army. Prosecutors requested he serve over 16 years in prison; he is due to be sentenced in September.

**China’s** agriculture ministry announced plans to stop **pork prices** from plunging. A persistent fall in the prices, a carefully-watched economic indicator, has compounded [deflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/10/deflation-and-default-haunt-chinas-economy) in the country. The government said guidelines on herd sizes should be followed more closely: China’s pig population, which makes up around half the global total, grew from 310m in 2019 to 434m last year.

### A less super Tuesday

This year’s Super Tuesday, when Americans in 15 states and one territory vote for candidates to be the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees, is unlikely to live up to its name. Normally, a candidate who wins big on Super Tuesday can expect to become his (or her) party’s nominee. This year the decision has already been made. President Joe Biden faces no serious challengers for the Democratic nomination.

There is hardly more suspense about [the Republican contest](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-republican-primaries-tracker). Donald Trump has dominated in 2024 and will probably continue to do so on Tuesday. All told, 874 of 2,429 delegates to the Republican convention in July are up for grabs. Mr Trump could lock up the nomination within a couple of weeks. Nikki Haley, Mr Trump’s sole remaining challenger, will face tremendous pressure from other Republicans to drop out of what has become a hopeless campaign. With her departure from the race, Mr Trump will be the Republicans’ de facto nominee.

### Will China set an ambitious growth target?

This year’s gathering of China’s rubber-stamp parliament (the National People’s Congress) [begins on Tuesday](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/03/03/crunch-time-for-xi-jinping-at-chinas-annual-political-meeting) with a state-of-the-nation speech from Li Qiang, the prime minister. The meeting of the legislature and the near-simultaneous one of its advisory body—known collectively as the “two sessions”—take place amid grim economic news. Factory production is shrinking, deflation has taken hold and property prices are falling.

Most observers will be focused on the government’s plans for 2024, in particular its economic growth target. Forecasters predict growth at between 4% and 5.2% with an average of 4.6%, according to *Bloomberg*. The government will probably announce a target at the high end of this range, of around 5%. To reach that it may have to provide more stimulus. Alternatively, it could aim lower, perhaps for 4.5%. That would demonstrate that even amid dire economic news, China is not prepared to gin up the economy, as many businesspeople would like it to.

### Can Europe arm Ukraine?

Fresh from his latest foreign-policy controversy, Emmanuel Macron arrives in Prague on Tuesday. The French president irritated some allies when he declared last week that he would not rule out sending ground forces into Ukraine to help it defeat Russia. The Czech prime minister, among others, countered that his country would not do so. French officials later said that Mr Macron was referring not to combat troops but to demining and other military specialists.

Mr Macron also said that France would take part in a Czech-run emergency effort to source ammunition for Ukraine from outside the European Union. This will be discussed during his visit. The ammunition scheme is based on bilateral contributions, not EU finance.

When it comes to EU aid to Ukraine, however, the French support “[European preference](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/14/can-europe-arm-ukraine-or-even-itself)” as a means of building up the continent’s defence industry. The European Commission’s Defence Industry Strategy, published on Tuesday, will probably suit them. It proposes ways for EU governments to jointly buy more weapons for Ukraine.

### Italy’s lukewarm economy

Nobody could say that Italy’s economy is booming. Figures published on Friday showed that the economy grew by just 0.9% in 2023. Still, that matched France’s performance and outstripped Germany’s. And it was better than predicted by analysts and the government, which will on Tuesday release detailed accounts for the fourth quarter.

One of the drivers of [Italy’s recovery](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/08/can-giorgia-meloni-reinvigorate-italia-spa) from the pandemic has been a construction boom fuelled by a lavish tax subsidy for home improvements. But the tax break has played havoc with the national accounts. Last year’s budget deficit was 7.2% of GDP, way above the original target of 5.3%. Still, that may not trouble the markets. As inflation has risen, so has nominal output. That has cut the figure most anxiously watched by investors: Italy’s public debt to GDP ratio. It fell to 137.3% in 2023, from 140.5% in 2022.

### A school shooter’s father on trial

On Tuesday the father of a boy who opened fire at a high school in Michigan in 2021 goes on trial for involuntary manslaughter (he denies the charges). James Crumbley bought Ethan, 15 at the time, a Sig Sauer SP2022 9mm semi-automatic handgun four days before he used it to kill four students and wound seven others, including a teacher.

On the day of the shooting Mr Crumbley and his wife Jennifer were summoned to the school after a teacher found a drawing of [a gun](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/05/25/why-america-should-make-it-harder-to-buy-guns), a bullet and a wounded person on Ethan’s desk. The couple refused to take him home. He murdered schoolmates hours later.

In December, Ethan was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Last month, in the first lawsuit holding a parent accountable for a child’s crime, Jennifer was found guilty of the charges her husband now faces. Mr Crumbley’s defence partly hinges on whether Ethan’s diary entry suggesting his father had hidden the gun will be admissible in court.
