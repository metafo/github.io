## The world in brief

### November 10, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Israel** agreed to have daily four-hour pauses in the fighting in parts of northern **Gaza**, according to the White House. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have already [escaped south](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/08/all-parties-are-blaming-each-other-for-the-dire-situation-in-gaza) through an evacuation route, according to the UN. The **Israel Defence Forces** said they have captured or killed around 50 Hamas militants during battles in Gaza city. Earlier they claimed control of an important Hamas stronghold near Jabalia, in northern Gaza, after a [ten-hour battle](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/07/will-america-pull-the-plug-on-israels-invasion-of-gaza).

**Spain’s** Socialist Party reached an agreement with Junts per Catalunya, a Catalan separatist party, to form a [new government](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/23/spains-election-ends-in-deadlock). Junts agreed to back the Socialists in exchange for a controversial amnesty that would wipe out criminal charges against people who supported an illegal referendum for Catalan independence in 2017. The deal ends a four-month stalemate after a snap election in July.

**Joe Manchin**, a Democratic senator from West Virginia known for skirmishing with his own party, will not seek re-election in 2024. The announcement threatens Democrats’ ability to hold their majority in the Senate. It also fuelled speculation that Mr Manchin [might mount](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/20/the-case-for-a-third-party-campaign-in-2024-is-actuarial-not-ideological) a third-party bid for president: he said he would travel the country to gauge interest in a movement to “mobilise the middle”.

A federal judge in **Alaska** ruled that a ConocoPhillips [drilling project](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/02/09/joe-biden-is-not-quitting-fossil-fuels) known as **Willow** can go ahead. The Biden administration approved the colossal project in March, sparking lawsuits from an indigenous and environmental groups and criticism that the decision betrayed Joe Biden’s promise to ban new oil drilling on federal lands. Willow is located in the federally-designated National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.

**Apple** could pay €14.3bn ($15.3bn) in back taxes to Ireland, after an adviser to the European Court of Justice, the EU’s top court, said that a ruling by a lower court “should be set aside”. In 2016 [the EU said](https://www.economist.com/business/2016/09/03/the-eu13-billion-bite) that Ireland had artificially lowered Apple’s tax bill, breaking the bloc’s rules. Apple won an initial bid to overturn the decision in 2020.

**Nvidia** will release three new [artificial intelligence chips](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/01/the-ai-boom-has-turbocharged-nvidias-fortunes-can-it-hold-its-position) for China that comply with American export restrictions, according to local media. In October the Californian chipmaker said that newly-enforced restrictions would stop it from selling two high-performance chips in Chinese markets. The firm has held a dominant share of China’s $7bn AI chip market. Its share price ticked up on the news.

The **Ethiopian** army regained control of Lalibela, a town in the northern Amhara region, after losing it to regional militiamen, known as Fano, on Wednesday. The World Heritage Site—famed for its labyrinth of 12th-century rock churches—has recently been the site of several bouts of fighting. Fano has taken over [towns and cities](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/15/ethiopia-risks-sliding-into-another-civil-war) in the region this year, freeing prisoners and attacking garrisons.

### Negotiating the release of Israeli hostages

Israeli ground forces are poised around the headquarters of Hamas in the centre of Gaza city. Meanwhile, Qatari and American go-betweens are negotiating a last-minute agreement to secure the release of some of the estimated 240 [Israeli hostages](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/11/03/israels-top-hostage-negotiator-on-dealing-with-hamas) being held by Hamas—in return for a pause in the fighting. David Barne, the head of Mossad, Israel’s spy agency, recently flew to Doha to join the CIA’s director, William Burns, in talks with the Qatari leadership. (The Gulf state is one of Hamas’s [patrons](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/28/israels-new-plan-to-encircle-hamas).)

But some believe Hamas is simply dangling the prospect of releasing hostages in the hope of saving the lives of its leaders in Gaza, who are in Israel’s sights. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians are fleeing the city on foot southward. Israeli intelligence officials estimated that, on Wednesday alone, around 50,000 departed*.* The White House says Israel will now allow daily four-hour “humanitarian pauses” to give others a chance to flee.

### Russia’s sickly economy

In 2022 hydrocarbons kept Russia’s economy on its feet. Despite sanctions imposed by Western countries after the invasion of Ukraine, the economy only contracted by 2%, less than almost anyone had predicted. Yet 2023 has brought [further challenges.](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/28/the-costs-of-russias-war-are-about-to-hit-home) Lower oil prices—coupled with the G7’s “oil-price cap”, which restricts what buyers can pay for Russian exports—have dealt a heavy blow. Vladimir Putin’s decision to cut gas supplies to Europe has also hurt the economy.

Figures released on Friday are expected to show that Russian inflation rose again, to an annual rate of around 7%. As exports have fallen, demand for the rouble has declined. A weaker currency is, in turn, raising the cost of imports. Russia’s economy is not yet in crisis: it is probably growing, albeit slowly. Still, Russia’s problems are mounting. Mr Putin seems determined to keep financing the war regardless. The [latest budget](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/10/31/what-russias-new-budget-reveals-about-the-war-in-ukraine) will boost defence spending by nearly 70% in 2024.

### Allianz’s tentative recovery

Allianz, one of Europe’s [biggest insurers](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/04/03/how-allianz-is-dealing-with-market-turmoil), will report third-quarter results on Friday. Investors are optimistic. In the second quarter the German firm reported an 18% increase in net profit and forecast healthy operating profit for 2023.

That would be a change from last year. In May 2022 Allianz agreed to pay a fine of more than $6bn to America’s Securities and Exchange Commission after Allianz Global Investors, its American fund-management business, pleaded guilty to securities fraud. Allianz subsequently spent more than $140m on restructuring, and posted a worse-than-expected 23% fall in quarterly profit that August.

Although the firm is still recovering from the scandal, it was helped this year by the strong performance of its property and casualty business, where claims from natural disasters were relatively low. Even so, analysts predict that Allianz’s share price will continue to suffer from the AGI fallout in the years to come.

### Protecting the world’s polar regions

As global temperatures rise, the polar regions are suffering. Arctic sea ice has been dwindling steadily for decades. Meanwhile Antarctica sea ice has seen an unprecedented decline in recent years. This July its maximum extent was 2.84m km2 [smaller than the average](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/08/02/the-rapid-loss-of-antarctic-sea-ice-brings-grim-scenarios-into-view) between 1981 and 2010. The consequences are enormous: rising sea levels, the mass release of greenhouse gases from melting permafrost, and worsening climate change.

Lessening those outcomes is the objective of the “One Planet—Polar Summit”, the first international gathering dedicated to the poles. Its political segment begins on Friday in Paris; France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, is expected to attend. In 2022 France launched its first “polar strategy”. It outlined plans to create or renew marine-protected areas, stop exploiting fossil fuels and put stricter regulations on tourism around the poles. As hosts of the summit, the French hope to lead the way in strengthening international co-operation on the matter.

### The art of war

Can the visual arts help humanity understand war? On Friday the Imperial War Museum in London opens a series of galleries that consider the question. They display roughly 500 works of art, film and photography whose theme is the conflicts in which Britain and the Commonwealth have taken part since 1914. They take the visitor across large swathes of the world, including parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.

Artists featured include 20th-century painters and photographers such as John Nash, Anna Airy and Cecil Beaton. Works by contemporary figures such as Steve McQueen, a British artist and Oscar-winning filmmaker, and Emily Jacir, a Palestinian artist, also shine. The galleries, whose opening completes the museum’s multi-year redevelopment, explore the many ways that organised violence has changed the lives of people from different places and eras. In doing so, they expose the scars that war leaves behind.
