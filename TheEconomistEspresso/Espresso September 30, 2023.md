## The world in brief

### September 30, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

Hard-right Republicans in **America’s** House of Representatives voted down a last-ditch stopgap funding bill, sponsored by their own party, aimed at preventing a government [shutdown](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/28/americas-next-government-shutdown-could-be-the-strangest-yet). The congressmen are demanding swingeing cuts to America’s discretionary spending. The defeat is another blow to Kevin McCarthy, the beleaguered speaker of the House. Parts of the federal government are now set to shut down on October 1st.

China’s purchasing managers’ index showed an increase in **manufacturing activity** for the first time in six months, according to an official survey released on Saturday. Following a leap in industrial profits in August, the figures add to a modest improvement in mood surrounding the **Chinese economy**, which has [struggled to recover](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/24/why-chinas-economy-wont-be-fixed) from a post-covid malaise.

America’s government warned of an “unprecedented” build-up of **Serbian** troops on the border with **Kosovo**. Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, urged “immediate de-escalation” in a conversation with Aleksandar Vucic, [Serbia’s](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/06/05/why-is-there-trouble-in-kosovo-again) president. Tensions in the former Serb province have been running high since four people were killed in a shoot-out between Serbian gunmen and Kosovo police last weekend.

Early results in a presidential election in the **Maldives** put Mohamed Muizzu, an opposition leader who favours increasing ties with China, comfortably ahead of Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, the pro-India incumbent. Local media have already declared Mr Muizzu the winner. After coming to power in 2018 [Mr Solih](https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/09/24/an-election-upset-in-the-maldives) strengthened the Maldives’ ties with India while distancing the country from Chinese investors.

**Ukraine** hosted an international defence industry conference in an attempt to bolster local weapons production for its [counter-offensive](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2023-09-23) against Russia. Speaking at the forum in Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelensky, the president, said that he aims to make Ukraine a “large military hub”, prioritising air defence and de-mining technologies. Around 250 weapons producers from 30 countries attended.

**Armenia** said that more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians had [fled to the country](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/a-humanitarian-disaster-is-under-way-in-nagorno-karabakh) from **Nagorno-Karabakh**, a figure that represents around 80% of the enclave’s population. In a one-day war last week Azerbaijan took control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which had been run by Armenian separatists for three decades. The UN said it would send a humanitarian mission to the enclave at the invitation of Azerbaijan’s government.

“No one is safe” from **bedbugs** in Paris, said **France’s government**. Clément Beaune, the transport minister, said the government would act to “reassure and protect” Parisians from a widespread infestation of the blood-sucking pests. The highly mobile bugs have been spotted on various forms of public transport. Emmanuel Gregoire, the deputy mayor, warned that previous campaigns against bedbugs had failed to prevent them from breaching the centre of the capital.

***yi mei lun***, a moniker from Taiwan used to describe the “US scepticism” narrative being spread by disinformation from China. [Read the full story.](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/09/26/china-is-flooding-taiwan-with-disinformation)

### Another congressional governance failure

Barring a political [miracle](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/28/americas-next-government-shutdown-could-be-the-strangest-yet) on Saturday, the American government will shut down on October 1st for the fourth time in a decade. Earlier in the week the Senate passed a stopgap funding bill full of aid for Ukraine that made it [dead on arrival](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/09/20/republicans-are-turning-against-ukraine) in the Republican-led House of Representatives. Millions of government workers, including congressional staffers, could soon miss paychecks. Federal services, such as environmental inspections and passport processing, [could grind to a halt](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/27/what-happens-if-americas-government-shuts-down-this-weekend).

This legislative failure has been driven by a small but powerful faction of House Republicans that seeks to force through ultra-conservative policies and [topple](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/21/americas-dumbest-wildest-budget-fight-yet) Kevin McCarthy, speaker of the House. Mr McCarthy became the weakest House leader in memory after 15 rounds of voting in January. He can take heart in the knowledge that, in 1856, Nathaniel Banks [won](https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-longest-and-most-contentious-Speaker-election-in-its-history/) the job only after the 133rd ballot. Banks, however, never had to contend with a government shutdown. A path out of this mess remains elusive.

### Slovakia’s nail-biter election

Slovaks vote in early parliamentary elections on Saturday, after the governing coalition lost a no-confidence vote in December. The result is too close to call. For the past six months Smer, the party of Robert Fico, a former prime minister, has been leading the polls. But Progressive Slovakia, a liberal party led by Michal Simecka, has recently gained an edge. (Slovakia is now ruled by a caretaker government appointed by Zuzana Caputova, the president and a former member of Progressive Slovakia.)

Mr Fico’s party has taken on a pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian line. Opponents fear that if Smer regains power Slovakia, hitherto a staunch supporter of Ukraine, will become an ally to Hungary, obstructing efforts within the EU and NATO to aid Volodymyr Zelensky’s government.

What happens next will probably depend on whether Mr Fico or Mr Simecka can find coalition partners among the smaller parties. If neither party is able to form a stable government, a second election will be in the offing.

### The Australian football final kicks off

When the Collingwood Magpies and the Brisbane Lions run onto Melbourne Cricket Ground for the Australian Football League’s grand final on Saturday, the cheers will be quieter than usual. The showcase, which attracts 100,000 spectators, has been rocked by a furore over tickets. An unusually high number of corporate allocations meant even some top-tier members, who pay for guaranteed seats, were left without spots.

But that won’t deter the punters for long. Relative to population, the AFL is the best attended domestic-sports league in the world. Some 9.6m Australians support one of its 18 clubs; one in 21 Aussies belongs to one. In 2022 the league generated over A$944m ($601m) in revenue. And since September 22nd fans have been able to indulge their passion for the sport’s brawny tactics in “AFL 23”, a new game for the Xbox. Like its spectacular “marks”—acrobatic catches that provide some of the sport’s most exciting moments—Australian football is flying high.

### A show of art from Colombia’s Caribbean coast

Ofelia Rodríguez liked to collect things. At markets in Mexico and her native Colombia, she unearthed items such as a child’s doll and a figurine of a man. Objects that others discarded were her treasure. Over five decades the surrealist artist, who died recently, produced paintings, sculptures and drawings that have been exhibited across the Americas and in Europe. A new show featuring more than 50 of her works opens on Saturday at Spike Island, a gallery in Bristol, in south-west England.

Rodríguez’s colourful creations combine these *objets trouvés* with myths and symbols from the Caribbean coast. Animal horns curve up from an orange wooden crate (one of her “magic boxes”), which opens to reveal a pile of jean buttons, nestled like coins in a purse. Gabriel García Márquez, a great Colombian author, once said that “surrealism runs through the streets” of Latin America. Rodríguez’s alluring, sometimes jarring, art is a case in point.

### Weekend profile: Lina Khan, America’s top trustbuster

In 2017 Lina Khan, a student at Yale Law School, published a controversial article. She argued that Amazon, the e-commerce giant, was a monopolist, and that the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust laws had failed to rein it in. Since her [appointment](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/06/19/joe-biden-appoints-lina-khan-to-head-the-federal-trade-commission) as the FTC’s youngest-ever chair in 2021, Ms Khan has launched an aggressive antitrust campaign against big corporations. On Tuesday she took on her old foe: Amazon. The FTC and 17 states sued the company, alleging that it illegally keeps prices high, charges sellers unfair fees and stifles competition.

Ms Khan, now 34, was born in Britain to Pakistani immigrants. Her family moved to America when she was 11. Her interest in corporate misbehaviour sparked early: as a high-school newspaper editor she ran critical coverage of a branch of Starbucks that was preventing teenagers from sitting in the café. The article was picked up by the *New York Times*.

Before law school Ms Khan worked for the New America Foundation, a left-leaning think-tank. There, she became interested in—and incensed by—corporate consolidation. When asked about her hobbies in 2021, she listed photography and “trying to find the most obscure industry where I can find consolidation”. On her honeymoon Ms Khan ploughed through a book on corporations and American democracy. (Her husband, a cardiologist, opted for Jane Austen’s “Persuasion”.)

Since taking over the FTC, Ms Khan has led it with a single-minded vision, sometimes bruising the morale of long-time staffers in the process. She has pushed through new rules, including [banning “non-competes”](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/12/americas-trustbusters-plan-to-curtail-the-use-of-non-compete-clauses-good) (which bar employees of one company from working for a competitor) and asserting the agency’s authority to pursue privacy violations. Her past work informs her current efforts, but may risk constraining her mandate: Amazon lobbied for Ms Khan to recuse herself from investigating it, alleging bias.

Last year the FTC filed more merger lawsuits than in any year for over a decade, including an attempt to block Microsoft’s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a video-game developer. Although the FTC’s court victories have been limited on her watch, Ms Khan’s leadership has reframed public thinking about trustbusting. Companies have become more wary: deals are down in America, suggesting firms are avoiding larger acquisitions. Politicians, too, are more willing to bash big companies. If President Joe Biden fails to win re-election next year, Ms Khan’s tenure will expire. But antitrust cases can take many years to wind their way through the courts. Ms Khan’s legacy may long outlast her time in office.
