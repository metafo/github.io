Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**Imran Khan**, Pakistan’s former prime minister, was [sentenced to ten years in prison](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/01/30/imran-khan-is-convicted-again) for leaking state secrets. Mr Khan was found guilty of sharing the contents of a secret diplomatic cable after allegedly waving the document at a political rally. The former cricketer is already in jail on charges of corruption, barring him from taking part in Pakistan’s election on February 8th. Mr Khan denies all charges, decrying them as politically motivated.

The **EU’s economy,** as well as the **euro zone’s**, stagnated in the final three months of 2023. The EU’s economy grew by just 0.2% compared with a year ago. The performance of Germany was especially poor—its economy contracted by 0.3% compared with the previous quarter. But the decline in the biggest economy of the bloc was offset by better-than-growth in Italy and Spain.

The **IMF** upgraded its global growth forecast for 2024, citing the [resilience of the American economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/03/has-america-really-escaped-inflation), increased [fiscal support in China](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/30/china-edges-towards-a-big-bail-out) and the strength of several emerging-market economies. The fund now expects the world economy to grow by 3.1% this year, up from a prediction of 2.9% made in October.

**Hamas’s** leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said that the militant group was discussing a proposal to pause the fighting in [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/10/just-how-bad-is-it-in-gaza). The plan was negotiated by officials from America, Israel, Egypt, and Qatar. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, suggested that Israel would not agree to release large numbers of Palestinian prisoners or withdraw from Gaza until it achieves “total victory”.

Junts, a pro-independence Catalan party in **Spain,** tanked a bill that would largely have granted amnesty to separatists involved in the independence drive that started in 2012, and included an [illegal independence referendum](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/09/26/why-the-referendum-on-catalan-independence-is-illegal). Junts wanted additional exoneration from terrorism-related charges, but failed to make a deal with Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister. Mr Sánchez secured his role in part by [promising Junts the amnesty bill](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/01/18/spain-shows-regional-nationalists-make-bad-coalition-partners).

**America** reimposed sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned gold-mining company after the country’s top court upheld a ban on the [opposition leader](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/06/29/if-venezuelas-elections-were-fair-this-would-be-the-front-runner) running for president. America had eased sanctions, including [pausing oil sanctions](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/11/09/oil-traders-are-flocking-to-sanctions-free-venezuela) last October, after Venezuela’s autocratic president agreed to hold fair elections. But America said it would not extend the pause, set to end in April, if a free vote was not held.

**Neuralink**, Elon Musk’s brain-chip startup, implanted its first device in a human patient. Mr Musk said that initial results showed “promising neuron spike detection”. The implant, named Telepathy, seeks to help individuals control electronic devices using their thoughts. The technology is not new. Some of Neuralink’s competitors, such as Blackrock Neurotech, have already implanted many chips in human brains.

### What next for the Fed?

Global investors always listen when Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, speaks. But on Wednesday they will pay even closer attention than normal. At the end of a regular meeting the Fed will announce its latest interest-rate vote. Almost everyone expects the central bank to keep rates steady, as they have been for six months. The uncertainty is how Mr Powell will describe the Fed’s stance in the press conference that follows.

Inflation in America has slowed sharply over the past year, and is approaching the central bank’s target of a 2% annual pace. Dovish analysts think the Fed should cut rates quickly now, to avoid the monetary drag on the economy becoming more severe. But growth has been [remarkably resilient](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/29/americas-economy-is-booming-why-arent-its-bosses-happier), and hawkish analysts argue that rate cuts are not needed. Worse, they could even rekindle inflation. Markets are looking for Mr Powell to drop a hint about which camp reflects current Fed thinking.

### Boeing’s fall from grace

In January a panel plugging an unused emergency exit in an Alaskan Airlines [Boeing 737 MAX 9](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/09/faulty-door-plugs-open-old-wounds-at-boeing) blew out during a flight over Oregon. The image of a jet flying with a gaping hole in its fuselage will be on investors’ minds as the American aerospace giant reports its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. Boeing has lost more than 17% of market value since the incident.

Loose bolts probably caused it. After a series of inspections, they were found to affect other similar planes. American regulators have said that Boeing must now focus on quality control rather than increasing production.

But as airlines clamour for new aircraft, that may cause the aerospace giant to fall even further behind Airbus. Boeing’s European rival is far ahead for deliveries of short-haul jets and has an order backlog of around 7,800 of these planes. Boeing has a smaller order book of some 4,800 for its 737 MAXs. It will struggle to catch up.

### Novo’s weighty dilemma

Novo Nordisk, Europe’s most valuable company, is due to publish its annual results on Wednesday. Investors will be eager to hear about the Danish drugmaker’s outlook for Ozempic and Wegovy, its blockbuster medicines that treat diabetes and obesity respectively. Jefferies, an investment bank, predicts that annual demand for weight-loss drugs could hit $150bn by 2030.

But Novo faces headwinds. In America, its largest market, insurers have been slow to cover Wegovy, which costs around $1,300 per month. A bigger worry is competition. Last November regulators approved Zepbound, an alternative drug from Eli Lilly, an American rival. Others may soon be on the way. *Stat*, an online health publication, estimates that over 90 candidates for [weight-loss drugs](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/expect-a-bumper-year-for-weight-loss-drugs) are in various stages of development. For now, though, demand outstrips supply. In 2023 Novo’s shares surged by 53%, well ahead of its Big Pharma peers. Shareholders will be hoping that its purple patch continues this year.

### Social-media bosses get a grilling

The chief executives of the biggest social-media companies will be summoned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to face an inquisition by senators. The heads of Meta, TikTok, X, Snap and Discord will answer questions from the Senate judiciary committee about their efforts to [protect children](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/21/americas-states-are-trying-to-set-rules-for-the-internet).

Moderating social media is a contentious and partisan issue. Democrats say that social apps are not doing enough to stamp out hate speech and misinformation. Republicans counter that the platforms are overly censorious and fail to uphold free speech. The result is congressional deadlock.

But there are areas of political consensus, among them the trading of child-abuse images, the grooming of minors and the generation of so-called deepfake videos (of which Taylor Swift, a pop star, is the latest high-profile victim). Two bills designed to curb online child exploitation passed the Senate last year. Wednesday’s hearing is more than a talking shop.

### When Truman Capote betrayed his friends

Nearly 50 years after it was published in *Esquire*, “La Côte Basque, 1965” still has the power to shock. [Truman Capote’s](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/08/03/eliza-clark-nods-to-truman-capote-in-penance-a-tale-of-murder) barely fictionalised account of New York high society is not just indiscreet, but humiliating. Readers are told about an abortive liaison between Sidney Dillon (really William Paley, the founder of CBS, a TV network) and “the governor’s wife” (Happy Rockefeller). They learn that Ann Hopkins (Ann Woodward), who may have murdered her husband, earned the nickname “Madame Marmalade”, because she supposedly liked preserves on “hot cock” for breakfast.

It was not an outsider’s portrait: Capote was friends with the women he vituperatively portrayed. “Feud: Capote vs. The Swans”, a new mini-series starring Calista Flockhart, Tom Hollander, Demi Moore and Naomi Watts, dramatises the aftermath. The women cast him out; Woodward committed suicide. “What did they expect?” Capote said. “I’m a writer. I use everything.” Perhaps he had not expected the fallout. As he became increasingly isolated, Capote descended into alcoholism and drug abuse.
