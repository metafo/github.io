**Donald Trump** dealt a blow to a bipartisan [border-security](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/01/24/americas-border-crisis-summarised-in-ten-charts) bill, newly unveiled by **America’s** Senate after months of wrangling. The Republican frontrunner in the forthcoming presidential election denounced the bill as “horrendous” and called for a separate piece of legislation to cover immigration. The deal, worth $118bn, ties border security to aid for Israel and Ukraine, which American lawmakers have struggled to deliver due to Republican opposition. An initial vote on the bill is scheduled for Wednesday.

**King Charles III** has cancer, Buckingham Palace said. His public duties have been paused though he “remains wholly positive” and looks forward to returning to his public work soon. The cancer was found last month when the king, who is 75 years old, received treatment for an enlarged prostate; the palace did not specify which kind of cancer. [He was crowned last May](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/05/04/britain-crowns-charles-iii-its-new-king).

**António Guterres**, the secretary-general of the **United Nations**, appointed an independent review group to assess allegations that workers at the [UN Relief and Works Agency](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/29/is-unrwa-complicit-or-unlucky) were involved in Hamas’s assault on Israel on **October 7th**. A final report is expected to be completed by April, and will be made public. Several governments have frozen donations to the agency in the meantime.

The Netherlands-based owners of **Yandex**, a [tech business](https://www.economist.com/business/2017/09/30/yandex-russias-biggest-technology-company-celebrates-20-years), announced the sale of the company’s Russian operations for 475bn roubles ($5bn). The firm, which runs Russia’s biggest search engine and once boasted a market capitalisation of $30bn, will be acquired by a group of Russian investors. The deal marks the biggest [corporate exit](https://www.economist.com/business/western-businesses-pull-out-of-russia/21807961) from Russia since the invasion of Ukraine two years ago.

**Antony Blinken**, America’s secretary of state, arrived in the Middle East for [negotiations](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/01/americas-shuttle-diplomacy-to-wind-down-the-war-in-gaza) over the **Israel-Gaza** war. Mr Blinken is expected to push for a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages. Earlier, America’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said there would be further strikes on Iranian proxies after a drone attack killed three American soldiers in Jordan last month.

**Snap**, the parent company of social-media platform Snapchat, said it would cut around 500 jobs, representing 10% of its global workforce. The firm, which is due to report quarterly earnings on Tuesday, has carried out several rounds of layoffs since 2022. Last week Evan Spiegel, Snap’s CEO and co-founder, was [grilled](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/01/the-end-of-the-social-network) alongside other social media executives by a Senate committee about the harm their platforms have caused children.

**Heavy storms** buffeted **California**, bringing floods and power outages to the state. A meteorologist at the National Weather Service said the [extreme weather](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/01/12/eight-charts-illustrate-2023s-extreme-weather) could be “potentially historic”, with mudslides reported in Los Angeles, the state’s biggest city. More than 800,000 people are believed to be without power, and authorities have ordered evacuations in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.

### The European consumer to the rescue

In January headline and core inflation (the latter excludes volatile prices such as energy) in the euro zone edged down by a tenth of a percentage point, to 2.8% and 3.3%. If inflation does not fall faster, the European Central Bank might delay cutting interest rates. That will hurt an already [weak economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/12/europes-economy-is-in-a-bad-way-policymakers-need-to-react). Forecasters are thus banking on those consumers whose wage increases are now outstripping inflation to spend more to buoy the economy. Whether that happens will become clearer when retail-trade figures for December are released on Tuesday, tracking Christmas spending.

Retail-trade volumes, which were stagnant for almost all of 2023, should start to pick up as real wages recover. But consumer confidence in the EU did not improve in January; nor did that of retailers. Overall, the euro-zone economy is recovering only slowly, and employment expectations have edged down, signalling a cooling labour market. European consumers are unlikely to go on a spending spree soon.

### What’s down the road for Toyota

The world’s biggest carmaker, Toyota, reports third-quarter results on Tuesday. Interest will centre on what the Japanese company says about scandals at Daihatsu, a subsidiary, and Toyota itself. Daihatsu suspended shipments of cars in December after it was discovered to have rigged safety tests. Toyota stopped making some models last month after diesel-engine tests were also found to have been manipulated. Akio Toyoda, the company’s chairman, said it had “lost the sight of its founding principles”.

The firm may comment on its commitment to battery power, after a recent slowdown in the growth of sales of [electric vehicles](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/04/16/how-japan-is-losing-the-global-electric-vehicle-race) around the world. This could be of benefit to Toyota, for which hybrids make up a third of sales and pure EVs only a sliver. While other carmakers have made firm commitments to go all-electric, Toyota plans to keep the petrol pumping. It recently said it would continue to develop new combustion engines.

### Nevada’s invisible caucus

Americans could be forgiven for thinking that the [next Republican primary](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2024/01/24/trumps-comfortable-win-in-new-hampshire-spells-trouble-for-nikki-haley) is on February 24th in South Carolina, where Nikki Haley has been relentlessly campaigning against [Donald Trump](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/trump-biden-polls/). In fact it is in Nevada. But the state’s Republican Party has made the process [irrelevant](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/01/how-nevadas-republicans-made-their-primary-irrelevant). Nevadans can either vote in a primary on Tuesday, or a caucus on February 8th. Ms Haley is running in the primary, and Mr Trump in the caucus.

What gives? The legislature passed a law in 2021 creating a state-run presidential primary. Republicans revolted and opted to hold a caucus anyway, and barred any candidate running in the primary from competing in it. The caucus will be the only way candidates can earn delegates, who will vote for the eventual party nominee. The result is confusion—and probably low turnout. At a recent rally in Las Vegas, Mr Trump revealed the triviality of the vote. “Don’t waste your time on primary”, he said. “Waste all of your time on caucus.”

### Senegalese democracy in peril

Violent clashes are likely to continue on Tuesday in Senegal, long considered a beacon of democratic stability in Africa. On Saturday President Macky Sall indefinitely [postponed the election](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/04/senegals-democracy-hangs-by-a-thread) scheduled for February 25th. Mr Sall’s justification for staying beyond his mandate is to allow time for a parliamentary inquiry into allegations of corruption against the Constitutional Council, which vets presidential candidates. Opponents decry a “constitutional coup”. The police arrested a candidate at protests on Sunday.

As MPs debated an exemption to the constitution to permit a delay on Monday, mobile internet was cut, motorbikes (popular with young protesters) were banned and a television station was shut down. If the bill passes in parliament, that could mean an election in six months, already long past Mr Sall’s elected mandate. Yet much is uncertain; one proposal in parliament suggests a full year’s delay and tight restrictions on who could be a presidential candidate. That would stoke bigger protests still. Senegal’s crisis may only be beginning.

### The EU’s new climate plan

On Tuesday the European Commission is due to unveil its latest [climate strategy](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/07/in-europe-green-policies-rule-while-green-politicians-struggle), detailing how it intends to cut carbon across the EU by 2040. The EU’s executive arm is expected to propose a 90% “net” reduction of emissions, compared with 1990—meaning that some pollution can be offset by natural sequestration (by forests, say) plus carbon capture and storage technology.

The proposal has already come under fire. Various technologies allow for the emissions released by burning fossil fuels, or through some industrial processes, to be absorbed, transported, stored underground or re-used. But most are expensive and inefficient, and do not yet exist at the scale required.

Environmentalists have railed against relying on such “speculative” technologies, which they argue will act as a disincentive to cutting back on fossil fuels. But the EU is already being assailed by [angry farmers](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/01/europes-grumpy-farmers-are-a-symptom-of-wider-malaise) protesting against its green regulations. That leaves it with a difficult needle to thread.
