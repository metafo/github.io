Hopes were dashed for a **ceasefire deal** before the start of [Ramadan](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/07/ramadan-could-see-respite-for-gaza-or-widening-violence) between Hamas and Israel. Many Muslims will begin fasting on Monday after a crescent moon, which marks the beginning of the holy month, was observed in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Negotiations appear to have stalled. Egyptian officials said they remain in touch with both Hamas and Israel in the hope that a deal can be reached soon. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said that the death toll from Israel’s offensive in the enclave exceeds 31,000.

Earlier, President **Joe Biden** accused **Binyamin Netanyahu**, Israel’s prime minister, of “hurting Israel” with the mounting death toll in Gaza. But Mr Biden also reiterated that the “defence of Israel is still critical”. Meanwhile, America’s army dispatched a ship to Gaza carrying equipment to [build a temporary pier](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/08/will-joe-bidens-new-plan-bring-relief-to-gaza) off the enclave’s coast. The pier would receive much-needed aid shipments but could take up to 60 days to build.

**America** airlifted its non-essential embassy staff out of **Haiti**. Since early March [gangs have attacked](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/03/07/the-last-scraps-of-the-haitian-state-are-evaporating) government buildings, police stations and the country’s main port. They already controlled much of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Caribbean leaders are expected to meet on Monday to discuss the “dire” situation. The gangs want Ariel Henry, the prime minister, to resign.

**Saudi Aramco**, an [oil giant owned by the Saudi state](https://www.economist.com/business/why-saudi-aramco-could-be-eclipsed-by-its-qatari-nemesis/21808310), reported profits of $121bn in 2023, down from $161bn in 2022. Lower oil prices partly explain the fall. Even so, the profits were the firm’s second-highest ever. The company said that last year it raised its dividends, a crucial source of income for the Saudi government, by 30% to $97.8bn.

**India** signed a trade pact with the European Free Trade Association. India’s trade minister said his country would [waive most tariffs](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/17/india-must-abandon-protectionism) on industrial goods from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. These countries have agreed to invest $100bn in India over 15 years. India has recently signed similar deals with Australia and the United Arab Emirates; it is reportedly in the late stages of negotiations with Britain.

Cabin crew of **Lufthansa**, Germany’s biggest airline, called a two-day strike for better pay. The action is scheduled to take place on Tuesday and Wednesday. Staff believe they should benefit more from the firm’s recent bumper results. It earned record profits of €1.7bn ($1.8bn) in 2023. The strike, which follows one by ground staff last week, could affect 100,000 travellers.

**Emmanuel Macron**, France’s president, said that he supported introducing legislation to permit [assisted dying](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/11/13/the-welcome-spread-of-assisted-dying), and that he hoped a bill would go before parliament in May. In an interview with *Libération*, a left-leaning newspaper, Mr Macron suggested that the legislation would allow assistance to die “under certain strict conditions”. Other European countries, including Spain and Germany, have [introduced similar measures](https://www.economist.com/international/2021/11/13/in-the-west-assisted-dying-is-rapidly-becoming-legal-and-accepted)

### Japan’s two-track economy

On Monday Japan will reveal revised estimates for GDP in the last quarter of 2023. The initial estimates showed a 0.4% contraction, the second straight quarter of decline. That meant that [Japan’s economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/07/will-a-fiscal-mess-thwart-japans-nascent-economic-growth) was technically in recession. Thanks to strong capital expenditure, economists expect the revised numbers to be rosier—perhaps rosy enough to affirm that Japan was not in recession. Nonetheless, consumption probably remained sluggish, casting doubt on the economy’s strength.

The real economy’s struggles stand in stark contrast with [Japan’s stockmarkets](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/22/as-the-nikkei-225-hits-record-highs-japans-young-start-investing), which are booming. Bumper corporate profits, a weak yen and rising shareholder returns have lured international investors back to Japan. The benchmark Nikkei stock index is up around 20% since the start of the year, breaking an all-time high set in 1989. For the economy to prosper as the stockmarket is doing, companies will need to raise wages enough to encourage growth in domestic demand.

### Chaos reigns in Haiti

On Monday Caribbean leaders are expected to meet in Jamaica to discuss the [crisis in Haiti](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/03/07/the-last-scraps-of-the-haitian-state-are-evaporating). They have invited officials from other countries, including America, Canada and France. Gangs control 80% of Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital. In early March they took over critical buildings such as police stations and government offices, and attacked the airport. The most prominent gang leader said the aim was to topple Ariel Henry, the prime minister. He has ruled unelected since the assassination of Haiti’s president in 2021 and is very unpopular.

The Caribbean leaders may add to the pressure on Mr Henry to resign. He is in Puerto Rico, unable to return safely to Haiti. His resignation could make way for a transition government and then, eventually, elections. But any peaceful solution relies on the arrival of a planned security mission. Kenya has agreed to lead the UN-authorised deployment but does not yet have enough money or soldiers as countries hesitate over committing troops. With or without Mr Henry, Haiti’s path ahead is treacherous.

### Biden’s budget day

America’s Congress is still haggling over this year’s budget. But negotiations are about to begin on next year’s. On Monday Joe Biden will release his plan for the coming fiscal year. The president’s blueprint has no chance of becoming law because Republicans control the House of Representatives. But the budget is an opportunity for him to say what his priorities are ahead of the [presidential election](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/trump-biden-polls).

He is likely to propose a [refreshed version of Bidenomics](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/30/bidenomics-is-an-unfinished-revolution-what-would-four-more-years-mean). The plan may feature increased spending on health insurance for the elderly, on tax credits for young families and on preschools. To pay for all this, Mr Biden will call for higher taxes on corporations and the rich. Republicans will call it a reckless tax-and-spend budget; Mr Biden will deem it essential to the country’s future. Fiscal policy may not be top of mind for most voters. But those who care will have two starkly different visions to choose between in November.

### Who can buy a leading conservative British newspaper?

Should an entity backed by a foreign government have a controlling stake in one of Britain’s most influential conservative newspapers? That question may soon be answered by Ofcom, Britain’s media regulator. Monday is the deadline for the watchdog to provide a report to Lucy Frazer, the culture secretary, on the proposed purchase by RedBird IMI of Telegraph Media Group, the owner of the *Daily* and *Sunday Telegraph*.

The prospective buyer is a joint venture between RedBird Capital Partners, an American firm, and International Media Investments. That is the investment vehicle of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates. He is known to many Britons as the owner of Manchester City, a successful English football club. Ofcom’s report will cover whether the deal poses a threat to free expression and to news impartiality. The *Telegraph* has run many articles critical of the sale, which is also opposed by a large number of Conservative MPs.

### A media scandal on stage

“Succession” was a television show that [dramatised a power struggle](https://www.economist.com/culture/2021/10/29/the-success-of-succession-proves-the-virtue-of-hateful-characters) within a media empire. Its creator admitted that Rupert Murdoch’s real-life dynasty was an inspiration. Fans of the show, which [ended last year](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/02/what-happens-when-a-story-loses-a-main-character), will probably enjoy “Corruption”, a play by J.T. Rogers. It is now playing at Lincoln Centre in New York.

The play focuses on a scandal at the *News of the World*, a now-closed British tabloid owned by Mr Murdoch. In 2011 it was revealed that journalists at the paper had hacked the phones of many prominent Britons. One victim was Tom Watson, then a Labour MP. “Corruption” dramatises Mr Watson’s efforts to take on Rebekah Brooks, a former editor at the *News of the World* who had become an executive in Mr Murdoch’s business. (Ms Brooke left her job owing to the scandal in 2011, but was acquitted of criminal charges and returned to work for Mr Murdoch in 2015.) A halo of screens hangs above the stage. That makes “Corruption” feel less like theatre and more like a Netflix series.
