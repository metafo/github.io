Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



**Houthi** militants claimed responsibility for a missile attack that killed at least two crew members on a commercial ship in the Gulf of Aden, causing the first fatalities since the beginning of the [Houthis’ violent campaign](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/12/who-are-the-houthis-the-group-attacking-ships-in-the-red-sea) off the coast of Yemen. The remaining crew evacuated the vessel. The group claims that its attacks are in protest of Israel’s war in Gaza, though in practice [attacks have been random](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/01/12/the-houthis-have-survived-worse-than-americas-and-britains-strikes).

**Nikki Haley** ended her campaign for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination, after losing 14 of 15 state primaries to Donald Trump on **Super Tuesday.** Ms Haley urged Americans to “turn away from the darkness of hatred and division”, and pointedly declined to endorse Mr Trump. Ms Haley’s exit sets the stage for a [second contest](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/trump-biden-polls) between Mr Trump and President Joe Biden in November.

Jeremy Hunt, **Britain’s** chancellor, delivered the government’s budget. Mr Hunt’s flurry of announcements included a cut of two percentage points to the rate of national insurance, a payroll tax. He also promised to end Britain’s controversial [“non-dom” tax status](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/04/07/what-are-non-doms-and-why-does-it-matter-that-rishi-sunaks-wife-is-one) for wealthy foreigners. He proposed instead a “modern residency system”, under which new arrivals would start paying taxes on foreign income after four years in Britain.

**Egypt** secured an $8bn [deal](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/01/egypt-doesnt-deserve-a-bail-out-but-should-get-one) with the **IMF** shortly after the central bank hiked its key interest rate and allowed the Egyptian pound to float. The government also received a $1.2bn loan for environmental sustainability. Previously the IMF had demanded a more flexible exchange rate for the currency as a precondition for delivering financial support to the government.

Jihadists are suspected to have kidnapped dozens of people in north-east **Nigeria**. They are believed to be affiliated with [Boko Haram](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/05/01/what-is-boko-haram), an Islamist group. The number of victims could range from around 50 to more than 300, most of them women. The abduction could be one of the largest in the region since 2014, when Boko Haram kidnapped over 270 schoolgirls.

**Spain’s** data-protection regulator temporarily banned Sam Altman’s cryptocurrency project, **Worldcoin**, from collecting personal data over privacy concerns. The company uses biometric data to verify users’ identities, and says that it deletes or encrypts it. But a number of countries, including South Korea and Argentina, have opened investigations into the venture.

Dina Boluarte, **Peru’s** president, swore in Gustavo Lino Adrianzen as the [country’s](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/02/22/what-javier-milei-could-learn-from-perus-economic-successes) prime minister. His predecessor, Alberto Otárola, resigned on Tuesday after audio clips emerged in which he seemed to declare his love for a woman and ask for her CV. Mr Otárola, who denies all wrongdoing, has since been accused of trying to help her secure lucrative government contracts.

### Modi visits Kashmir

India’s general election is due to begin in April. Narendra Modi, the prime minister, is in campaign mode. This week he embarked on a ten-day tour of the country to extol his government’s achievements at massive rallies. His visit on Thursday to Srinagar, the biggest city in Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, will be particularly significant.

It is Mr Modi’s first trip to the city since his government in 2019 [removed the additional autonomy](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/12/11/indias-top-court-upholds-the-central-governments-grab-at-kashmir) given to the state by India’s constitution. The amendment fulfilled a long-standing promise by Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. It pleased the party’s Hindu-nationalist supporters, who had objected to the state’s special status. But now the federal government subjects Kashmiris to direct rule, lockdowns and restrictions on internet use. Mr Modi’s government insists that the changes have brought peace and prosperity; disaffected [Kashmiris disagree](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/10/the-mirage-of-peace-and-prosperity-in-kashmir). But they are not Mr Modi’s target audience: on Thursday in Srinagar he will be speaking to the rest of India.

### Biden’s high-stakes speech

Democrats may find themselves holding their breath on Thursday when Joe Biden delivers the annual state-of-the-union address. It is the highest-stakes speech of his presidency to date.

A general-election rematch with Donald Trump is all but certain. Many voters will make up their minds in the next three months. *The Economist*’s [poll tracker](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/trump-biden-polls) has Mr Trump ahead of Mr Biden nationally by two points, but polls of the critical swing states give him a bigger lead. Many voters think Mr Trump is better at dealing with the economy and the border.

On Thursday Mr Biden needs to argue that he has made progress on the economy. He will have to blame the Republicans for blocking progress on fixing such problems as undocumented immigration. Above all, he must allay growing anxiety that at 81 he is no longer up to the job. That would be a tall order for even the most nimble and eloquent of presidents.

### The ECB on hold

Economists had thought there was a slim chance that European inflation would ease enough for the [European Central Bank](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/13/has-the-european-central-bank-become-too-powerful) to start cutting interest rates in March or April. But those hopes were dashed by February’s figure: consumer prices were 2.6% higher than a year before. When it meets on Thursday the bank will probably say it needs more data to be confident that the inflation rate will fall to its 2% target before making cuts.

The inflation numbers are worrying. Seasonally adjusted, February’s month-on-month increase in consumer prices implies an annualised inflation rate of 5%, after 5.2% in January. Even excluding energy prices, the annualised figure is 3.5%. Compared with three months ago prices, excluding energy, are 3.4% higher in annualised, seasonally adjusted terms. That number had hit a low of 1.6% in November. Europe’s economy will probably have to wait until June for an ECB rate cut.

### The Kremlin tightens its grip on Russia’s tech sector

Yandex, a search engine and internet-services firm, has long been Russia’s most prominent tech company. On Thursday shareholders in its parent company, which is based in the Netherlands and listed in New York, are expected to approve the sale of its Russian business, which accounts for 95% of revenues, for around $5bn. The buyer is a consortium led by a division of Lukoil, one of Russia’s largest energy companies. The Kremlin was closely involved in the negotiations, and welcomed the deal.

The state has gradually [increased](https://www.economist.com/business/russia-is-trying-to-build-its-own-great-firewall/21807706) its control over the country’s tech sector in order to restrict the information that Russians get online. The invasion of Ukraine accelerated the process. In 2022 Yandex sold its popular news and blogging services to VK, a state-run conglomerate. Meanwhile, Yandex’s co-founder, Arkady Volozh, who lives in exile in Israel, left the company after the European Union imposed sanctions against him. He has since called the war “barbaric”. The bloc may soon take him off the sanctions list.

### Feel the “Illinoise”

To some Americans Illinois is part of “flyover country”. But “Illinoise”, a dance musical, describes the state as “a special, air-filled, hard-to-reach place”. The show premieres at the Park Avenue Armory in New York on Thursday.

It is based on “Illinois”, an album released in 2005 by [Sufjan Stevens](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2020/09/25/sufjan-stevenss-astounding-miscellany), a genre-bending American singer-songwriter. Justin Peck, a choreographer who is in residence at the New York City Ballet, co-wrote the story with Jackie Sibblies Drury, a Pulitzer prize-winning playwright.

Mr Stevens’s songs on the marvels and mysteries of the state are the framework for the narrative. It is told by a group of young people, but most central is Henry, a gay man entangled in a complex love affair. Like the soundtrack, the choreography defies categorisation, combining ballet with tap and punk. The 16-strong cast brings to life a story of longing and belonging in an often overlooked place.
