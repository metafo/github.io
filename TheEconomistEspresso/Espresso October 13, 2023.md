## The world in brief

### October 13, 2023

Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter



------



America’s secretary of state, **Antony Blinken**, visited **Israel** in a show of solidarity after it was [attacked by Hamas](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/07/israel-reels-as-hamas-launches-a-spectacular-and-bloody-offensive), promising that [America](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/09/hamass-carnage-upends-joe-bidens-plans-for-the-middle-east) would “always” be by Israel’s side. Mr Blinken, who invoked his Jewish heritage, said the Palestinian incursion had “harrowing echoes” of the Holocaust. He said he would urge other countries in the region to rein in the conflict. Meanwhile, **Syria** said that Israeli missiles had hit airports in Aleppo and Damascus, putting both out of action. On Friday the foreign minister of Iran, an ally of Syria and an enemy of Israel, is due to visit Syria.

**America** will block **Iran** from accessing the $6bn in Iranian funds that was transferred to Qatar [last month](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/18/irans-6bn-hostage-deal-is-part-of-a-broader-diplomatic-strategy) in exchange for the release of imprisoned Americans. Republicans have slammed President Joe Biden for making money available to Iran—even with strict restrictions—since Hamas’s attack on Israel. American officials said no evidence tied Iran to the operation, but it has historically supported the terrorist group.

**America’s** annual rate of consumer-price **inflation** held at 3.7% in September, maintained by high housing costs. Economists had expected a slightly lower figure after energy prices eased. The new data, alongside [America’s continuing jobs bonanza](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/06/a-jobs-bonanza-stirs-fears-the-american-economy-is-overheating), raise concerns about the stickiness of inflation above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Policymakers may be tempted to resume their protracted fight against inflation before long.

Federal prosecutors charged **Bob Menendez**, a senator from New Jersey, and his wife, with conspiracy to have Mr Menendez act as a foreign agent of Egypt—even as he served as the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His lawyer called the accusation “absurd”. Last month Mr Menendez was indicted on [eyebrow-raising bribery charges](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/28/bob-menendezs-indictment-is-colourful-even-by-jersey-standards) (he pleaded not guilty).

The head of the **Israel Defence Forces**, Herzi Halevi, acknowledged the [failure of his forces](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/09/hamass-attack-was-an-israeli-intelligence-failure-on-multiple-fronts) to prevent Hamas’s attack from Gaza on Saturday. It was his first public statement since the incursion. “We will learn, we will investigate, but now is the time for war,” said Mr Halevi. Israel said 1,300 people had been killed by rockets and Hamas fighters.

**Hollywood studios** and their striking talent failed to reach a deal. Members of the Screen Actors Guild [walked out](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/19/hollywoods-blockbuster-strike-may-become-a-flop) in July over [demands](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/14/an-all-out-strike-brings-hollywood-to-a-halt) for higher wages and a revenue-sharing deal with streamers. Talks were “no longer moving us in a productive direction,” according to representatives of the studios. Last month screenwriters clinched a deal with studios [ending months of strikes](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/25/hollywoods-strike-enters-its-final-act-as-writers-reach-a-deal).

**Cricket** fans booked overnight hospital check-ups in Ahmedabad, India, to secure accommodation ahead of Saturday’s [World Cup match](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/10/04/narendra-modi-has-seized-and-politicised-indian-cricket) between **India** and **Pakistan**, two of the sport’s biggest rivals. Hotel prices have seen a more than ten-fold increase and airfare has quadrupled in the run-up. The local hospitals’ association encouraged doctors to turn down fans’ requests, saying hospitals are meant for patients.

### No escape from Gaza

On the evening of October 7th, the first day of [Hamas’s](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/10/how-powerful-is-hamas) attack on Israel, Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, warned the residents of Gaza to “leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere”.

Air strikes on Gaza, which is governed by Hamas, began on the same day. Many of [Gaza’s 2m residents](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/10/people-in-gaza-hate-the-night-all-they-can-see-are-explosions) want to take Mr Netanyahu’s advice to flee, but it is not clear where they can go. Israel will not let them in. Some reports say that Egypt, Gaza’s southern neighbour, has closed its border. The problem, claims Egypt’s government, is that the Rafah border crossing isn’t working because Israeli missiles have struck it several times.

Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s president, may well be trying to stop an influx from Gaza. Egypt’s economy is already in [terrible shape](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/03/egypts-rushed-election-shows-abdel-fattah-al-sisi-is-nervous). The country has recently received more than 100,000 refugees from Sudan’s civil war. So far Egypt has seemed unwilling to offer itself as a haven for the frightened people of Gaza.

### A chilly reception for the EU in China

Josep Borrell, the European Union’s top diplomat, will be in China on Friday to begin talks in earnest amid geopolitical and trade tensions that have soured relations. During his three-day visit Mr Borrell must navigate a dense agenda ranging from human rights and economic arrangements to Ukraine and now the Middle East.

The EU wants to “de-risk” its economy by reducing its dependence on China; the bloc is reviewing whether electric vehicles imported from China are competing unfairly with its own products. At the same time it would like to sway China away from its tacit support for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. The repercussions of the terrorist attacks in Israel will provide yet another source of discord: Hamas has been forcefully denounced across Europe, but not in China. Pressure from back home for Mr Borrell to denounce China’s human-rights abuses will only add to the chilly diplomatic atmosphere.

### Putin ventures abroad

Vladimir Putin is in Kyrgyzstan on his first official trip abroad since the International Criminal Court [indicted](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/04/14/why-russia-is-deporting-ukrainian-children) him for war crimes in March. On Friday he will attend a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a Russian-led talking-shop comprising ten former Soviet countries.

The CIS is supposed to demonstrate Russia’s regional clout. But the Kremlin’s influence over some members is waning. Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, will be absent, as his country reels from Azerbaijan’s assault on [Nagorno-Karabakh](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/a-humanitarian-disaster-is-under-way-in-nagorno-karabakh) last month, which caused more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians to flee the enclave. Russia, Armenia’s traditional security partner, had pledged to ensure the region’s security but did little to stop the offensive. That inaction may partly have been punishment for Armenia’s recent westward pivot, yet seems only to have accelerated the country’s drift away from Russia. Last week Armenia’s parliament voted to join the ICC, obliging the country to arrest Mr Putin should he visit.

### The world’s record-breaking temperatures

Each month three datasets provide a snapshot of global temperatures. Few have been so closely watched as September’s. The first, published last week by Copernicus, the EU’s Earth-observation programme, found monthly average surface air temperatures of 16.38°C—almost 1°C over the 30-year average and 0.5°C above the previous September record. Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist, called such anomalies “absolutely gobsmackingly bananas”.

On Thursday Berkeley Earth, an American research group, confirmed his analysis. They found that September was the most excessively hot of any month since 1850. The third data release, from NASA’S Goddard Institute for Space studies, is due out on Friday and expected to show much the same. This summer’s scorching weather makes it almost inevitable that 2023 will be the hottest year ever. It seems highly likely, too, that temperatures for 2023 will approach or exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the [talismanic target](https://www.economist.com/interactive/interactive/briefing/2022/11/05/the-world-is-going-to-miss-the-totemic-1-5c-climate-target) laid out by the Paris Agreement.

### Talor Swift fans get ready for it

From Friday bejeweled Taylor Swift fans in more than 100 countries can watch a film of concerts from her latest tour at the cinema (although due to unprecedented demand Americans and Canadians got an early showing on Thursday). “Swifties” will be getting a cut-price singalong. Tickets in America cost $19.89 (a nod to an album called “1989”, the year she was born). For her live gigs they can cost hundreds of dollars.

The projected revenues for “The Eras Tour”, which began in March and ends in November 2024, including tickets, merchandise and sponsors, amounts to about $1bn. The film version, even before its release, is the most profitable concert film in history. More than $100m-worth of tickets have been sold worldwide.

Its timing is lucky for a film industry that is in a funk after a summer of showbiz strikes. Concert films, unlike most, don’t need script writers or actors. Ms Swift’s spectacle, and another from Beyoncé, due to be released in December, could help the industry shake it off.
