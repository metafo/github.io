Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

The **UN Security Council** passed a resolution to boost the aid allowed into **Gaza**. The intensely negotiated final draft calls on parties to “create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities”. **America** abstained from the vote, allowing the proposal to pass; it had objected to earlier drafts that demanded a ceasefire and gave the UN (rather than Israel) the power to inspect aid deliveries into the [enclave](https://web.archive.org/web/20231223072219/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/14/israels-current-large-scale-operation-is-the-last-one-in-gaza). Russia, objecting to the weakened document, also abstained.

In a policy shift seen as intended to help [Ukraine’s war effort](https://web.archive.org/web/20231223072219/https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/12/17/ukraines-army-is-struggling-to-find-good-recruits), **Japan** is to allow the sale of advanced [Patriot air-defence](https://web.archive.org/web/20231223072219/https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/24/patriots-promise-ukraine-its-first-defence-against-ultra-fast-russian-missiles) systems to **America**. Despite the easing of its strict restrictions on weapons exports, it cannot sell Patriots, which are American-designed, directly to Ukraine. But, by adding to America’s stockpile, the move may free up other supplies.

America’s **Supreme Court** declined to fast-track one of **Donald Trump’s** appeals, opting to let it process first through lower courts. Jack Smith, the special counsel [trying the former president](https://web.archive.org/web/20231223072219/https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/06/a-primer-on-trumps-criminal-trials) for allegedly attempting to steal the 2020 election, had requested the expedited review. The trial is scheduled for March. Mr Trump, who denies wrongdoing, argues he should be immune from prosecution for actions he took while in office.

**France** will reportedly close its embassy in **Niger**, citing restrictions imposed by the country’s military government on the mission’s operations. French diplomats had already left in September, when tensions mounted, following the army’s ousting in July of Mohamed Bazoum, the democratically elected president. Local staff have now also been dismissed. France [withdrew all 1,500 of its troops](https://web.archive.org/web/20231223072219/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/25/why-emmanuel-macron-is-pulling-french-troops-out-of-niger) stationed in its former colony.

**Wisconsin’s** supreme court said that the state’s electoral maps were unconstitutional. It ordered the legislature to draw new maps before the 2024 election—a race in which Wisconsin is considered highly competitive. The map, which the court said created districts that were not physically contiguous, [favours Republicans](https://web.archive.org/web/20231223072219/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2017/10/07/the-supreme-court-ponders-whether-gerrymandering-has-gone-too-far). Liberal justices won a [majority](https://web.archive.org/web/20231223072219/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/26/why-winning-a-wisconsin-supreme-court-race-matters-so-much) on the court in 2023.

Shares in **China’s biggest online-gaming companies** plunged in value after Chinese authorities announced [curbs](https://web.archive.org/web/20231223072219/https://www.economist.com/business/china-imposes-the-worlds-strictest-limits-on-video-games/21804100) on spending on video [games](https://web.archive.org/web/20231223072219/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/12/14/macau-chinas-sin-city-wants-to-be-more-like-las-vegas). The rules ban some common incentives, such as rewards for players who log in every day, or spend on a game for the first time. Shares in Tencent Holdings fell by 16% at one point, and those in its rival, NetEase, by 25%.

### 2023 in review: Our books of the year

*This week we are looking back on 2023. Here are our culture picks of the year.*

For books on current affairs try “Deadly Quiet City”, which examines the experiences of eight people during the covid-19 lockdown in Wuhan, China. “Flowers of Fire” chronicles the enduring misogyny of South Korean society and the way its women have banded together to combat it.

Our favourite books on business include “Anansi’s Gold”, which tells of one of the world’s biggest con artists. In “The Geek Way” a technology-and-business guru from MIT explains how the mindset that inspires Silicon Valley can be usefully applied in other areas of business (and life).


“The Fraud”, by Zadie Smith, is one of the best novels of the year. This historical yarn centres on a butcher’s claim to be the heir of an English aristocrat. We also recommend “Western Lane”, by Chetna Maroo: a slim, subtle debut novel of grief and growing up. Our [full list](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/12/01/the-best-books-of-2023-as-chosen-by-the-economist) also includes books on culture, ideas and history.

### 2023 in review: The best television of the year

The best television of 2023 included exceptional comedies, crime dramas and psychological thrillers. In “Beef” a road-rage incident brings Amy Lau, a woman with lots of money, into the orbit of Danny Cho, a second-rate contractor. Mutually assured destruction ensues. Set in 2010, “[The Good Mothers](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/04/05/the-good-mothers-casts-a-light-on-the-women-of-the-ndrangheta)” tells the stories of women who dared to defy the ‘Ndrangheta, the mafia in Calabria. “Colin from Accounts”, a charming Australian comedy, follows Ashley and Gordon, strangers who are brought together by an injured dog.


Some of our favourite shows also came to a fitting close this year. In the fourth and final season of “Barry”, Barry Berkman, a hitman who reinvented himself as an actor, now finds he has lost his cover and freedom. The final season of “The Crown” turns the spotlight on [recent history](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/11/much-of-the-crown-is-nonsense). Jesse Armstrong, the creator of “Succession” gave the Roy family [a superb send-off](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/02/what-happens-when-a-story-loses-a-main-character), with the back-stabbing and blackmailing reaching new heights. For more recommendations, read our [full list](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/17/the-economists-pick-of-the-best-television-shows-of-2023).

### 2023 in review: The best films of the year

As is often the case, some of our favourite films of 2023 were based on reality. “Maestro”, a biopic of Leonard Bernstein, is rich, sensitive and sympathetic. In “[Oppenheimer](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/07/14/realism-with-oppenheimer-or-escapism-with-barbie)”, a technically magnificent biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan asks what kind of person would build a weapon that could destroy the world. “Reality” tells the true story of a young whistleblower, Reality Winner, who was questioned in her home by FBI agents in 2017.


Others were mystical and fantastical. [Hayao Miyazaki](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/06/04/for-hayao-miyazaki-flight-is-a-metaphor-for-freedom), a co-founder of Studio Ghibli, has said that “The Boy and the Heron” will be his last film—and what a swansong it is. The cryptic, cosmic fairy tale is about letting go of the past. In “Poor Things” a woman is brought back from the dead by a mad scientist with no memory of her previous life. Our [full list](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/10/the-best-films-of-2023-as-chosen-by-the-economist) features films about cattle barons, chefs and Iranian journalists.

### 2023 in review: The best podcasts of the year

Our [favourite podcasts](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/24/these-are-the-economists-favourite-podcasts-of-2023) of the year covered subjects including empire, medical scandals and war. “The Kids of Rutherford County”, the latest podcast from Serial and the *New York Times*, investigates the collapse of the juvenile-justice system in a county in Tennessee. In “The Retrievals” women who underwent egg retrievals recount their nightmarish experiences and highlight an enduring problem: that parts of the medical establishment still ignore women’s suffering.

For lighter listens, we recommend “If Books Could Kill”, in which the hosts rip apart the schlocky books you might buy in an airport. In “Drifting Off with Joe Pera” Mr Pera, an American comedian, invites listeners to doze off to his relaxing tones, with each episode featuring tales of the mundane. “Normal Gossip” is a masterclass in storytelling. Each episode of this podcast recounts drama from the banal worlds of farmers’ markets, flatshares and first jobs. Perfect holiday listening.
